SPACE (FX)TITLE CARD: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.... A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by a roll up, which crawls up into infinity...Episode IIATTACK OF THE CLONESThere is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to secede from the Republic.The separatist movement, under the leadershipof Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knightsto maintain peace and order in the galaxy.Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to the Galactic Senate to vote on       the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE      REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi…PAN UP through a vast sea of stars to reveal the amber city-planet of Coruscant. Two yellow N-1 Naboo starfighters fly OVER CAMERA towards the planet, followed by a large chrome-covered Naboo cruiser and one more fighter.INT. NABOO CRUISER -- DAWNA LIEUTENANT and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS address SENATOR AMIDALA as the Cruiser nears the planet. LIEUTENANT: Senator, we’re making our final approach in to Coruscant. SENATOR AMIDALA: Very good, Lieutenant. EXT. CITYSCAPE (CORUSCANT) – DAWNThe ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet. The ships fly into a thick bank of smog that covers the skyline.  EXT. LANDING PLATFORM (CORUSCANT) – DAWNTwo Naboo fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Naboo Cruiser lands on the central leaf, and the third fighter lands on the remaining platform. A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. A FEMALE PILOT steps out of her N-1 and walks toward the group. Behind her, ARTOO-DETOO drops down from the Naboo fighter. The other FIGHTER PILOT jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet, revealing himself as a black man with an eyepatch over one eye. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, Senator Amidala’s Security Officer. He moves over to the FEMALE PILOT. TYPHO: We made it. The ramp lowers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear first. Then Senator Amidala, her handmaiden VERSE and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. Amidala is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation. The dignitaries start to move forward. TYPHO: I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all…FEMALE PILOT: There’s always danger, Captain. Sometimes we’re just lucky enough to avoid it.Senator Amidala reaches the foot of the ramp --  -- when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a HUGE EXPLOSION!!! The dignitaries and pilots are hurled to the ground as the gleaming starship is instantly destroyed. Klaxons blare, alarms sound! In what seems like an instant, many dead and wounded victims lay scattered about the platform. Captain Typho and the escort pilot gets up and run to where Senator Amidala lies dying. The female pilot pulls off her helmet, revealing herself as the real PADME NABERRIE AMIDALA, Senator of Naboo.PADME: Corde…Padme kneels down and gathers her decoy double in her arms. The woman is horribly injured – it’s clear nothing can save her. Corde’s eyes open. She looks up at her…CORDE: I’m so sorry, m’lady… i’ve failed you, senator….PADME: No….Corde dies in Padme’s arms without hearing her denial. She hugs her late decoy, sobbing uncontrollably.TYPHO: M’Lady, you are still in danger here.Padme lowers Corde’s lifeless body to the ground, slowly gets up, and looks with tear-streaked eyes at the devastation around her. Artoo Detoo rolls up alongside them -- Typho’s Artoo unit lies destroyed in the distance. Typho looks around nervously.PADME: I shouldn’t have come back.TYPHO: This vote is very important. You did your duty -- Corde did hers. Now come.Padme doesn’t move. She continues to stare glassy-eyed at the carnage around her. TYPHO: Senator Amidala, please!She slowly turns, and they walk away. Artoo lets out a small whimper and rolls after them.EXT. SENATE BUILDING – DAYThe massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off. INT. SENATE CHAMBER – DAY The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor’s majordomo, tries to quiet things down as SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE confers with an aide, UV GIZEN, who rides on a small one-man floating scooter. UV GIZEN: They are afraid, Supreme Chancellor. Many have heard reports of demonstrations, even violent activity near this very building. The separatists –PALPATINE: They are a troublesome group. It would seem that Count Dooku has whipped them into murderous frenzy. Or perhaps their frustrations are mounting despite the effort of that estimable former Jedi to calm them. Either way, the separatists must be taken seriously. Mas Amedda pounds the podium for silence. MAS AMEDDA: Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedence, and that is what we will vote on at this time.Everything quiets down. The aide disperses, and with a grim look on his face, Palpatine then steps to the podium.PALPATINE: My esteemed colleagues, excuse me…I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system…has been assassinated. There is a shocked silence in the vast arena. PALPATINE: This… grievous blow…is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice – not only here in this honorable assembly, but also on her home planet. (sad beat, then continues) She was so loved, the people would have gladly elected her Queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom… and as a dear friend. A moment of silence. Then three-eyed Senator ASK AAK of the Congress of Malastare raises his floating podium into view before Chancellor Palpatine’s podium. ASK AAK: How many more senators will die before this civil strife ends?!? We must confront these rebels now, and we need an army to do it!!A second pod comes into view. Inside it is DARSANA, Ambassador of Glee Anselm. DARSANA: Why weren’t the Jedi able to stop this assassination?? We are no longer safe under their protection!!Senator ORN FREE TAA floats into view next. ORN FREE TAA: The Republic needs more security NOW – before it comes to war!! PALPATINE: Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists? Peace is our objective here, not war -- ORN FREE TAA: (incredulous) You say this while your friend lies dead, assassinated by those same people with whom you wish to negotiate?!? The crowd erupts in a fury. Dissenting opinions fill the air, and Mas Amedda tries to calm things down. Suddenly, to Palpatine’s and the Senate’s surprise, Senator Amidala (with Captain Typho, a well-dressed JAR JAR BINKS and the handmaiden DORME in tow) comes forward in her pod!! PADME: My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war!! A shocked beat of silence. Then the Senate fills with wild cheering and applause. Palpatine is stunned, but quickly recovers. PALPATINE: I-it is with great surprise and joy the chair recognizes the Senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala. PADME: Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. (lets that sink in) I was the target. But more importantly, I believe this security measure before you was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army…but there is somebody in this body who will stop at nothing to assure its’ passage…Several Senators leap out of their seats, booing Padme loudly. Others shake their heads in confusion – is Padme accusing one of them of attempted murder?!?PADME: I warn you. If you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war firsthand – I do not wish to do so again. The Senate is filled with jeers and boos. ORN FREE TAA: This is insanity, I say! I move that we defer this vote immediately! The Senators are now arguing and yelling at each other, both for and against her statements. Padme’s iron temper slips. PADME: WAKE UP, SENATORS!!!The Senate is stunned into silence. PADME: You must wake up!! If we offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives, ALL will lose their freedom! This decision could well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic! I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. VOTE DOWN this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here WANT that?? I cannot believe they do…There is an undercurrent of boos and groans from the Senators. Orn Free Taa moves his pod next to Padme’s. ORN FREE TAA: My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law. Padme stares daggers at the obese Twi’lek senator. Palpatine looks at her with a mixture of pity and weariness. PALPATINE: In view of the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands adjourned. On Padme’s pod, a small viewscreen comes up, saying that the Chancellor wants to meet with her in private. WIPE TO:EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.INT. CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE – DAYA weary Chancellor Palpatine sits behind his desk with his female aide SLY MOORE alongside him. Two RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS stand on either side of the door at the other end of the room. YODA, PLO KOON, KI-ADI MUNDI and MACE WINDU sit across from him. Behind them stand the Jedi LUMINARA UNDULI and her Padawan, BARRISS OFFEE.PALPATINE: I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. And I fear that further delay on this definitive issue might well erode the Republic through attrition. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.MACE WINDU: When the vote is done, if they do break away - PALPATINE: No! I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years be split in two! My negotiations will not fail. MACE WINDU: If they do, you must realize there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.PALPATINE: Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?The little green Jedi Master closes his eyes and concentrates. YODA: Worse than war, I fear…much worse. PALPATINE: What?MACE WINDU: What do you sense, Master?YODA: Hmm…The Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is. But this I am sure of…(opens his eyes) Do their duty, the Jedi will. A muted buzzer sounds. A hologram of a Rodian aide, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor’s desk. DAR WAC: (in Huttese) The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honor. PALPATINE: Good. Send them in. We will discuss this matter later.Mace rubs his chin, his thoughts troubled. The others all stand as Senator Amidala, Captain Typho, Mas Amedda, Dorme, and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, Jar Jar Binks, and HOROX RYYDER) and their ATTENDANTS enter the office. As Yoda moves to greet the Senator, he taps Amidala with his cane. YODA: Padme, your tragedy on the landing platform…terrible. With you the Force is strong, young Senator. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart. PADME: Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind this attack? MACE WINDU: (gets up and joins them) Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moon of Naboo. Padme frowns, shaking her head. PADME: I don’t wish to disagree…but I think that Count Dooku was behind it. The assembled group looks at each other in surprise. Mace Windu is most disturbed of all. KI-ADI MUNDI: He is a political idealist. Not a murderer.MACE WINDU: You know, my Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. (smiles) He couldn’t assassinate anyone. It’s not in his character. PALPATINE: Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?PADME: I don’t know. But everything in my being tells me he was behind it. YODA: Hmm. In dark times, nothing is what it appears to be. But the fact remains for certain, Senator…in grave danger you are. Palpatine walks to the window and looks out at the vast city, his back to the others. He thinks for a moment, then turns around. PALPATINE: (to Mace) Master Jedi, may I suggest the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces. BAIL ORGANA: Do you really think that is a wise decision under these stressful times? Thousands of systems have gone over to the separatists, and many more may soon join them. The Jedi are our -- PADME: Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the –PALPATINE: (finishes her sentence) -- situation is that serious, no. But I do, Senator. PADME: Chancellor, please! I don’t want any more guards! Palpatine considers this. Unnoticed, Yoda narrows his eyes and scowls at him. PALPATINE: I realize all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you. But perhaps someone you are familiar with, an old friend, like…Master Kenobi?He looks at Mace as he suggests this. Mace nods. MACE WINDU: That’s possible. He’s just returned from a border dispute on Ansion. PALPATINE: You must remember him, M’Lady – he watched over you during the blockade conflict. PADME: This is not necessary, Chancellor. PALPATINE: I insist – do it for me, M’Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you… is unbearable. Padme lets out a reluctant sigh. MACE WINDU: I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M’Lady. PADME: (resigned) Thank you, Master Jedi. Mace bows before Padme and leaves. Yoda hobbles to her side next and leans into her ear. YODA: Too little about yourself you worry Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padme. Accept our help.  The Jedi leave the office.EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING – LATE DAYA graceful skyscraper shines in the sunset light of Coruscant.INT. APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR – LATE DAYIn a moving windowed elevator attached to the outside of the Senate Building, two Jedi wait. They are OBI-WAN KENOBI and ANAKIN SKYWALKER. Obi-Wan is now thirty-five, with long hair and a graying beard. He strongly resembles the late Qui-Gon Jinn now, in more ways than one. Anakin, meanwhile, is virtually unrecognizable. The nineteen-year-old towers over Obi-Wan, and is lanky and handsome. While he wears his hair in the manner of a Padawan Learner (short and spiky with a long braid), his uniform is darker and more stylish than the usual apprentice. Obi-Wan waits patiently as the elevator climbs; Anakin squirms and nervously rearranges his robes. OBI-WAN: You seem a little on edge. ANAKIN: Not at all. OBI-WAN: I haven’t felt you this tense since…since we fell into that nest of gundarks. ANAKIN: You fell into that nightmare, Master, and I rescued you. Remember? OBI-WAN: (beat) Oh...yes. Obi-Wan laughs quietly. Anakin grins, but remains on edge. OBI-WAN: You’re sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath. ANAKIN: I haven’t seen her in ten years, Master…OBI-WAN: She’s not the Queen anymore. ANAKIN: (under his breath) That’s not why I’m nervous. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING – APARTMENT CORRIDOR – TWILIGHTThe door to the apartment slides open. Jar Jar walks into the corridor, and spots Obi-Wan and Anakin exiting the elevator. He recognizes Obi-Wan and becomes extremely excited, jumping around in glee, shaking his hand. JAR JAR: Obi? OBI!! Mesa sooooo smilin’ to see yousa!! WAHOOO!!! OBI-WAN: (grins) It’s good to see you too, Jar Jar. Jar Jar calms down and looks over at Anakin. JAR JAR: And dis, mesa guessin’, issen yousa appren…tice… (like Andy Kaufman’s Latka) Nooooooo!!! ANI?!?Anakin nods and smiles. JAR JAR: Nooooooo!! Little bitty Ani?!?Anakin nods again, grinning. JAR JAR: NOOOOOOO!! Yousa so biggen!!  Yiyiyiyiyi!! Ani!! ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar. Jar Jar grabs hold of Anakin and envelops him in a huge hug. JAR JAR: Shesa expecting yousa. Ani…Mesa no believen!INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT -- TWILIGHTPadme is in a conference with Captain Typho and Dorme at the open balcony of her apartment. Jar Jar enters the room, followed by the two Jedi.JAR JAR: Senator Padme! Mesa palos here. Lookee lookee, Senator. Desa Jedi arriven!Padme, Dorme and Typho leave the balcony and walk into the apartment as Obi-Wan and Anakin stop before the Senator. Obi-Wan steps forward and bows before Padme. Anakin stares at Padme; she glances at him.  OBI-WAN: It’s a great pleasure to see you again, M’Lady.Padme walks over to Obi-Wan and takes his hand in hers. PADME: It’s been far too long, Master Kenobi. I’m so glad our paths have crossed again…but I must warn you that I think your presence here is totally unnecessary. OBI-WAN: Well, I’m sure the Jedi Council has their reasons. Padme’s eyes go wide as she notices…PADME: ANI?!?She doesn’t seem to recognize the now fully-grown Anakin. The apprentice steps forward before her.PADME: My goodness, you’ve grown. They stare at each other for a long moment. ANAKIN: So have you…grown more beautiful, I mean.	Obi-Wan glares at Anakin’s attempt to be smooth. Anakin notices and gets nervous. ANAKIN: Well, for a Senator, I mean…Padme laughs and shakes her head. PADME: Ani, you’ll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine. Anakin blushes and looks down as Obi-Wan and Typho smile. OBI-WAN: Our presence here will be invisible, M’Lady, I can assure you.			The group sits down to discuss the security arrangements. TYPHO: I’m Captain Typho, head of Her Majesty’s security service. Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment. I’m very grateful you’re here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.PADME: I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who’s trying to kill me!OBI-WAN: (frowning) We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.ANAKIN: We will find out who’s trying to kill you, Padme. I promise you. Obi-Wan looks askance at Anakin as he boldly declares this. He’s done it again. Anakin bites his lip, in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN: We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.ANAKIN: I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course…OBI-WAN: We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin. And you will pay attention to my lead.ANAKIN: Why?OBI-WAN: (sharply) What??!!Jar Jar gulps.ANAKIN: Why else do you think we were assigned to protect her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.OBI-WAN: We will do exactly as the Council has instructed. (beat) And you will learn your place, young one.Anakin lowers his head. Padme and Typho have been watching this scene sympathetically. Now Padme gets up. PADME: Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now, if you will excuse me, I will retire.Everyone else gets up. Obi-Wan gives Amidala a slight bow as she and Dorme leave the room.TYPHO: Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here. ANAKIN: What have you learned? Obi-Wan throws Anakin a warning look. TYPHO: Not much. She’s very determined to deal with the separatists through negotiation and not force. But the attempts on her life, even though they’ve failed, have only strengthened the opposition to her viewpoint in the Senate. OBI-WAN: And since the separatists would not logically wish to see a Republic army formed…TYPHO: We’re left without a clue. In any such incident, the first questioning eyes turn towards Count Dooku and the separatists…(quickly, on Obi-Wan’s sour look) or to some of those loyal to his movement at least. But why they’d go after Senator Amidala is anyone’s guess. OBI-WAN: (“end of discussion”) And we are not here to guess, but merely to protect. TYPHO: (bows) I’ll have an officer situated on every floor, and I’ll be at the control center downstairs. Typho leaves, and Obi-Wan starts to look around the apartment. JAR JAR: Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani. Desa bad times, bombad times.ANAKIN: (despondent) She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar. I’ve thought about her every day since we parted, and… she's forgotten me completely. JAR JAR: Shesa happy. Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time. OBI-WAN: You’re focusing on the negative, Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts. (kind smile) She was pleased to see us. Now lets check the security. ANAKIN: Yes, my master.EXT. SKYSCRAPER LEDGE – NIGHTAn armor-clad bounty hunter, JANGO FETT, waits on the ledge of a skyscraper as another bounty hunter, ZAM WESELL, a woman with a veiled face, steps from her hovering green speeder and approaches Fett. JANGO FETT: You know that we failed? ZAM WESELL: You told me to kill those in the Naboo starship. I hit the ship, but they used a decoy. Those who were aboard are all dead. JANGO FETT: We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam.  My client is getting impatient.  Fett hands Zam a transparent tube about a foot long, containing centipede-like KOUHUNS.JANGO FETT: Take these.  Be careful.  They're very poisonous.She turns to leave, but Fett calls her back. JANGO FETT: Zam… there can be no mistakes this time. She had better not escape you. ZAM WESELL: She won’t.Zam attaches her veil across the bottom of her face. She turns again and walks toward her speeder.WIPE TO: EXT. JEDI TEMPLE (CORUSCANT) – NIGHTThe vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted against the traffic-filled sky.INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR -- NIGHT Mace Windu and Yoda walk down a long hallway, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.MACE WINDU: Why couldn’t we foresee this attack on the Senator? This should have been no surprise. YODA: Masking the future is this disturbance in the Force. MACE WINDU: (sighs) The prophecy is coming true – the Dark Side is growing. YODA: And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future.MACE WINDU: It’s been ten years, and the Sith still have yet to show themselves. Do you think they are behind this…disturbance?YODA: (long beat) Out there, they are. A certainty that is.MACE WINDU: Do you think Obi-Wan’s apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?YODA: Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM – NIGHTAnakin is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear distant footsteps in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly Anakin’s eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back on his belt.The door to the apartment slides open, and Obi-Wan enters.OBI-WAN: Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here? ANAKIN: Quiet as a tomb. I don’t like just waiting here for something to happen to her.Obi-Wan checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of Artoo by the door, but no sign of Padme on the bed.OBI-WAN: What's going on?Anakin shrugs.ANAKIN: Aw, she covered the cameras. (sigh) I don't think she liked me watching her.OBI-WAN: What is she thinking?ANAKIN: She programmed Artoo to warn us if there is an intruder.INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM – NIGHTPadme is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. Artoo stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off. OBI-WAN: (V.O.) It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.ANAKIN: (V.O) I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don’t we, Master?  INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHTAnakin and Obi-Wan continue their conversation. OBI-WAN: (sour) You’re using her as bait.ANAKIN: It was her idea. Don’t worry, no harm will come to her – I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me. OBI-WAN: It’s too risky. Besides, your senses aren’t that attuned, my young apprentice. ANAKIN: And yours are? Obi-Wan glowers at the implied challenge. OBI-WAN: Possibly. ANAKIN: Time will tell then, who’s more in touch with the Force. EXT. SKYSCRAPER LEDGE – NIGHTStanding on the skyscraper ledge, Zam Wesell loads the cylinder carrying the deadly kouhuns into a PROBE DROID. She sends the probe droid out into the Coruscant night.  INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHTAnakin and Obi-Wan continue their conversation, moving out onto the apartment’s balcony. OBI-WAN: You look tired. ANAKIN: I don't sleep well anymore. OBI-WAN: Because of your mother? ANAKIN: (nods) I don't know why I keep dreaming about her. I haven't seen her since I was little… OBI-WAN: Your love for her was, and remains, deep. That’s hardly reason for despair. ANAKIN: But these are more than – (shakes his head) Are they dreams, or visions? Of something that is yet to be? OBI-WAN: I'm not sure what it means... but dreams pass in time. The two walk back into the apartment. ANAKIN: I’d much rather dream of Padmé. Just being around her again is… intoxicating. OBI-WAN: Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You’ve made a commitment to the Jedi Order, a commitment not easily broken. And the Jedi’s stand on such relationships is uncompromising. Attachment is forbidden. (snorts) And don’t forget she’s a politician, and they’re not to be trusted. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM – NIGHTANAKIN: (V.O.) She’s not like the others in the Senate, Master.As Padme sleeps, the probe droid approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A faint sound is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window. OBI-WAN: (V.O.) It's my experience that Senators focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they’re by no means scared of forgetting the niceties of a democracy to get those funds.ANAKIN: (V.O.) Not another lecture, Master. At least not on the economics of politics. It’s too early in the morning…The probe droid attaches a little tube to the hole in the window. The two deadly looking centipede-like kouhuns exit the tube, crawl through the blinds, and head toward the sleeping Padme. Artoo wakes up, and his lights go on. The kouhuns have scurried behind the bed on the opposite side from Artoo, however, and the little droid doesn’t see them. Artoo looks around, makes a plaintive little sound, then shuts down again. The creatures scurry up onto the bed…INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM – NIGHTAnakin and Obi-Wan continue their conversation. ANAKIN: And besides, you’re generalizing. The Chancellor doesn’t appear to be corrupt. OBI-WAN: Palpatine is a politician. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM – NIGHTThe kouhuns are only inches away from Padme’s face. They hiss, and wicked stinger tongues flicker from their mouths…OBI-WAN: (V.O.) I have observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM – NIGHTANAKIN: I think he’s a good man. My instincts are very positive about… that….A stunned look comes over Anakin’s face. He looks sharply at Obi-Wan. OBI-WAN: I sense it too.INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM – NIGHTArtoo whoops in alarm and shines a light on the bed. Obi-Wan and Anakin burst into the room. The kouhuns stand on their hind legs and hiss as Padme wakes up. Anakin throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.Obi-Wan notices the droid outside the window and rushes straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window. EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHTObi-Wan flies through the glass window and flings himself at the probe droid, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The probe droid sags under the weight of Obi-Wan, but continues to stay afloat and fly away with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.... INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT -- NIGHTAnakin and Padme stare at the sight of Obi-Wan being carried off by the droid. Anakin turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.ANAKIN: Stay here!Anakin rushes out the door as Captain Typho, Dorme and two guards rush in. DORME: Are you all right, M’Lady?Padme nods yes. EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT -- NIGHTThe probe droid sends several protective electrical shocks across its’ surface, causing Obi-Wan to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, Obi-Wan disconnects a wire on the back of the droid. Its power shuts off! Obi-Wan and the droid drop like rocks. Obi-Wan realizes the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The droid’s systems light up again, and it takes off. The droid bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takes the Jedi wildly between buildings and finally skims a rooftop as Obi-Wan is forced to lift his legs, then run across the roof, tenaciously hanging on to the droid.  EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS – ENTRANCE -- NIGHTAnakin charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the line of speeder traffic high above. EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT -- NIGHT The droid moves into incoming air traffic, trying to knock Obi-Wan off. The Jedi desperately dodges incoming speeders. In one speeder, a Dug shakes its fist at him. DUG: JEDI POODOO!!The droid heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, the scruffy bounty hunter Zam Wesell, sees the droid approach with Obi-Wan hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the Jedi. Explosions burst all around Obi-Wan.  OBI-WAN: I have a bad feeling about this…Zam grins and raises the rifle a bit higher. ZAM: Dodge this. The droid takes a direct hit and explodes. Zam runs to her speeder, jumps in, and takes off. Obi-Wan plummets fifty stories……and clutches on to the back of a speeder! Groaning with effort, he flips over into the passenger seat and sits down next to the driver – Anakin.  ANAKIN: (grinning) That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic! OBI-WAN: What took you so long?!? ANAKIN: Oh you know Master, I couldn’t find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit…and with the right speed capabilities…and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color…They zoom out in hot pursuit of Zam. Zam Wesell turns into incoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the Jedi off her trail. Oncoming speeders honk and swerve to avoid her and the Jedi.OBI-WAN: (rolls his eyes) If you’d spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman. ANAKIN: I thought I already did. OBI-WAN: Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.As this conversation is going on, Anakin deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic. Zam then flies her speeder sharply downward. Anakin steers his speeder down after her. The two speeders plunge straight down through moving lanes of air traffic. She finally levels off near a huge building; Anakin keeps shooting straight down, straight towards the roof. Obi-Wan tenses up as the building looms ever closer. OBI-WAN: Pull up, Anakin… PULL UP!!Laughing, Anakin finally pulls up just before he can smash into the building. The speeder misses the roof by inches. Obi-Wan is white as a sheet; Anakin’s having the time of his life. OBI-WAN: You know I don’t like it when you do that!!!ANAKIN: Sorry, Master. I forgot you don’t like flying. OBI-WAN: I don’t mind flying – but what you’re doing is suicide! As he says this, Anakin barely avoids a commuter train. Obi-Wan jumps. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. Zam weaves around flaming smokestacks at very close range, trying to set her pursuers on fire. The chase heads for a power refinery. Pulling out her laser pistol, Zam shoots a power coupler causing voltage, like lightning, to jump across a gap from one coupler to another. But Anakin stays on course, piloting the speeder directly through the arc. Anakin and Obi-Wan’s bodies ripple with blue power. Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass. OBI-WAN: Anakin, how many times have I told you to stay away from power couplings?!? The speeders finally fly out of the lightning. OBI-WAN: (sarcastic) Oh, that was good…ANAKIN: That was crazy!!!The Jedi tear after Zam. Zam goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. Zam turns down and left, into a transit tunnel built into a huge building. Anakin pulls up and to the right. OBI-WAN: Where are you going?!? He went that way!!  ANAKIN: Master, if we keep this chase going any longer, that creep is gonna end up deep fried! And personally, I’d very much like to find out who he is and who he’s working for!! This is a shortcut…I think.  OBI-WAN: What do you mean, ‘You think?’Zam’s speeder shoots out of the other end of the transit tunnel. Anakin’s speeder is nowhere in sight. Zam removes the veil from her face, smirking in satisfaction. Anakin turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways. He comes to a stop, hovering about fifty stories up. Obi-Wan folds his arms and looks disapprovingly at the searching Anakin. OBI-WAN: Well, you’ve lost him. ANAKIN: (he doesn’t mean it) I’m deeply sorry, Master.Anakin looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.OBI-WAN: That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. Once again, you’ve proved --ANAKIN: If you’ll excuse me? Suddenly Anakin jumps out of the speeder!! Obi-Wan looks down and sees Zam’s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. OBI-WAN: I hate it when he does that. Anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunter’s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. Zam looks up and realizes what has happened. Suddenly, Zam just stops, and Anakin flies forward to the left front fork. Zam shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a blast near Anakin’s hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. Anakin slides to the right fork of the speeder, where Zam can’t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop. Zam takes off, and Anakin slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but he manages to hang on. He works his way back to the speeder’s cockpit. Zam briefly changes back into her gray reptilian Clawdite form and sneers at him.Obi-Wan has jumped into the driver’s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Soon Anakin is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. Zam takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless Jedi, knocking the sword out of Anakin’s hand. Obi-Wan races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger’s seat. Anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and grabs the gun in Zam’s hand. They struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing the dashboard and speeder controls to bits. The speeder careens wildly out of control. Zam struggles to pull the speeder out of its’ nosedive. Obi-Wan gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunter’s speeder. Just as the speeder is about to nose dive into the ground, Zam pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. Anakin goes flying into the street. EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET – NIGHTAnakin slowly pulls himself up, clutching his ribs painfully. Zam leaps out of the smoking speeder and rushes out into the crowd. Anakin moves to give chase into the very crowded street. It’s the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected in filthy puddles. It’s pretty crowded with various alien lowlifes, panhandling droids, and the occasional group of upper-class slummers. Anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing Zam. He loses the bounty hunter in the crowd, then sees her again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd. Obi-Wan lands the speeder in the nearby street. He gets out and runs through the crowd toward Anakin.Ahead, Zam turns in through a door and disappears. A nightclub sign is flashing over the door. Anakin is just about to follow Zam into the nightclub when Obi-Wan catches up to him.                                                             OBI-WAN: Anakin!ANAKIN: She went into the club, Master --OBI-WAN: Patience. Use the Force. Think.ANAKIN: Sorry, Master. OBI-WAN: He went in there to hide, not to run. ANAKIN: Yes, Master. Obi-Wan then offers Anakin his lightsaber.OBI-WAN: Here. Next time try not to lose it. Anakin reaches for the lightsaber, but Obi-Wan holds it back. OBI-WAN: This weapon is your life. ANAKIN: (getting irritated) I’ve heard this lesson before – Obi-Wan finally gives Anakin the lightsaber. OBI-WAN: But you haven't learned anything, Anakin. Obi-Wan releases hold of the lightsaber. ANAKIN: I try, Master.Obi-Wan walks ahead through the club entrance. Anakin follows him.OBI-WAN: Why do I get the feeling you’re going to be the death of me?INT. NIGHTCLUB (CORUSCANT) – NIGHTObi-Wan and Anakin enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them. Anakin flinches at Obi-Wan’s last line, his eyes showing a bit of fear. ANAKIN: Don’t say that, Master. You’re the closest thing I have to a father. I love you, I don’t want to cause you pain. OBI-WAN: Then why don’t you listen to me?!?ANAKIN: I am trying. The two Jedi look around the crowded nightclub. Beings of all shapes, sizes and races are lounging around drinking and chatting. At the far wall, three giant screens are depicting sports events – a Podrace, droid football, and a nuna race. OBI-WAN: Can you see him? ANAKIN: I think he is a she…and I think she’s a changeling.  OBI-WAN: In that case, be extra careful. (nods to the room) Go and find her.Obi-Wan starts to move away. ANAKIN: Where are you going, Master? OBI-WAN: For a drink. Obi-Wan heads for the bar. Anakin blinks in surprise, then moves into the room where alien faces look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. Obi-Wan arrives at the bar. He nods to the bartender and points out a drink. CLOSE SHOT – Elsewhere in the room, someone unsnaps the safety on their holstered blaster…As Obi-Wan picks up his blue drink, he is immediately disturbed by a young gravelly-voiced troublemaker named ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO. 	                        ELAN: You want to buy some death sticks? Without even looking at him, Obi-Wan casually waves his hand in front of Elan’s face.OBI-WAN: You don’t want to sell me death sticks. ELAN: I don’t want to sell you death sticks…OBI-WAN: You want to go home and rethink your life.ELAN: I want to go home and rethink my life…The young thug wanders off, hypnotized. Obi-Wan downs his drink in one gulp. CLOSE SHOT: The blaster leaves its’ holster. Zam starts to move stealthily toward the bar…Anakin continues to wander through the bar, searching the faces for the assassin. Obi-Wan signals to the bartender for another drink. Zam sneaks up behind him as he reaches for his drink, blaster raised and aiming at the Jedi’s back…With lightning speed, Obi-Wan whirls around, igniting his lightsaber, and chops Zam’s blaster-arm clear across the room. Zam stumbles back with a gasp and lands on her rear, clutching her burnt stump. All talk in the room stops instantly. Anakin rushes over as Obi-Wan hauls up the injured Zam.ANAKIN: (to the crowds) Easy. Jedi business – go back to your drinks.Slowly, the patrons sit down and resume their merriment. The performers onstage resume their show. The two Jedi drag Zam out of the room. EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHTObi-Wan and Anakin carry Zam into an alley behind the nightclub and lower her to the ground. Obi-Wan starts to tend to her bleeding arm stump as she stares daggers at him and Anakin both. OBI-WAN: Do you know who it was you were trying to kill? She winces in pain, then nods. ZAM: It was the Senator from Naboo…OBI-WAN: And who hired you? She stares coldly at him. ZAM: It was just a job. ANAKIN: Who hired you?!? Tell us... ZAM: That Senator’s gonna die soon anyway. It won’t end with me. And the next one won’t make the same mistake I did. OBI-WAN: (frowning at the stump) This wound’s going to need treatment…ANAKIN: Tell us – TELL US NOW!!She stares glassy-eyed at Anakin, her lips twitching under Anakin’s Force-powered demand. Obi-Wan stares at him in surprise. ZAM: It was a bounty hunter called – FZZZT!! Zam suddenly seizes up, convulsing. The two Jedi look up at a WHOOSHING sound from above. A man, fully armored, his face hidden by a metal helmet, rises from a roof high above into the sky on a jetpack and flies out of sight. Zam’s face begins to undulate…then settles into a gray reptilian form as Zam, with a last gurgling noise and eyeblink of surprise, sags in death. Obi-Wan looks down at the dead Zam…and gingerly plucks a small metal dart out of the front of her neck. OBI-WAN: Toxic dart…He looks back up at where the armored man had flown away from. WIPE TO:EXT. JEDI TEMPLE – DAYThe tall spires of the Jedi Temple stand out against the blue sky. INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER -- DAYObi-Wan and Anakin stand in the center of a very worried Jedi Council. The Council members pass the toxic dart around each other. YODA: Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan. MACE WINDU: Most importantly, find out who he’s working for. OBI-WAN: What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting. YODA: Handle that, your Padawan will…Anakin is overjoyed to hear this. MACE WINDU: Anakin, escort the Senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She’ll be safer there. And don’t use registered transport – travel as refugees. ANAKIN: As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult to get Senator Amidala to leave the capitol. YODA: Until caught this killer is, our judgment she must respect. MACE WINDU: Anakin, go to the Senate and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter. Keep a low profile, Anakin – we want you off Coruscant before they can strike again. ANAKIN: Yes, Master. MACE WINDU: You are dismissed. YODA: May the Force be with you. The two Jedi bow and leave the Council Chamber. INT. SENATE BUILDING, PALPATINE’S OFFICE -- DAYAnakin joins Palpatine at the great window of his office, both staring side-by-side out at the vast city.PALPATINE: I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that. ANAKIN: Thank you, Your Excellency. Palpatine smiles warmly. PALPATINE: And so, my young Padawan…they have finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off. ANAKIN: Your guidance, more than my patience. Anakin and Palpatine turn away from the windows and walk through the office towards the door. PALPATINE: You don’t need guidance, Anakin. In time you will learn to trust your feelings…then you will be invincible. I have said it many times, you are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.ANAKIN: (pleased at the compliments) Thank you, your Excellency. PALPATINE: I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin. Even more powerful than Master Yoda. Anakin’s head is swimming with the Chancellor’s flattery. INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ATRIUM -- DAYObi-Wan walks alongside Mace Windu in one of the Temple’s many vast corridors. Yoda floats alongside on a tiny repulsor chair.OBI-WAN: I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet. YODA: The Council is confident in its’ decision, Obi-Wan. MACE WINDU: The boy has exceptional skills. OBI-WAN: But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him… well…. arrogant. YODA: Yes, yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Hmm…too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones. MACE WINDU: Remember, Obi-Wan – if the prophecy is true, your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance. OBI-WAN: (foreboding) If he follows the right path. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAYOutside Senator Amidala’s bedroom, a pair of floating droids fit a new window pane into place. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT – DAYAnakin looks on as Padme and Jar Jar talk, standing near the door of the anteroom to Padme’s bedroom. Dorme moves about, frantically packing luggage.  PADME: I’m taking an extended leave of absence. It will be your responsibility to take my place in the Senate. Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.  JAR JAR: You betcha yousa bottoms! PADME: (grin) What?!? Jar Jar cringes and clears his throat. JAR JAR: Mesa honored to be taken on dissa heavy burden. (pompously) Mesa accept dis with muy…muy humility anda --Padme cuts Jar Jar off in mid-speech with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The Gungan blushes. PADME: Jar Jar… I don’t wish to hold you up. I’m sure you have a great deal to do. JAR JAR: Of course, M’Lady. The Gungan bows, turns and leaves with a dazzling smile on his face. Padme walks briskly over to Anakin, in a very sour mood. PADME: I do not like this idea of hiding. ANAKIN: Don’t worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won’t take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter.Padme crosses over to her closet and starts to throw clothes into a suitcase on her bed. PADME: (frustrated) I’ve haven’t worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act to not be here when its’ fate is decided!!ANAKIN: Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us. PADME: PRIDE?!? Ani, you’re young and you don’t have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time!!Anakin is shaken by the hurt in Padme’s voice. ANAKIN: Sorry, M’Lady. I was only trying to – PADME: Ani, NO!ANAKIN: Please don’t call me that. PADME: What??ANAKIN: Ani. PADME: I’ve always called you that. It is your name, isn’t it? ANAKIN: It’s Anakin. When you say Ani it’s like I’m still a little boy… and I’m not. PADME: I’m sorry -- Anakin. It’s impossible to deny that you’ve…(smiles as she looks him over) that you’ve grown up. Anakin becomes a little shy. ANAKIN: Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. He crosses over to the new window as Padme continues to pack. He picks up a metal sphere and mentally raises it into the air, floating it around his arm with the Force. ANAKIN: Don’t get me wrong – Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. He puts the sphere back. ANAKIN: Only… although I’m a Padawan Learner, in some ways…in a LOT of ways…I’m really ahead of him. I’m ready for the trials, I KNOW I am! He knows it too! But he feels that I’m too unpredictable. Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it. I know I started my training late, but he won’t let me move on.Padme looks at him knowingly. PADME: That must be frustrating. ANAKIN: It’s worse. He’s overly critical, he never listens -- he doesn’t understand!! It’s not fair…PADME: Well, mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It’s the only way we grow.Padme fails to suppress a laugh, and shakes her head. Anakin scowls at her. PADME: I’m sorry. You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn’t get his way. ANAKIN: (pouting) I’m not whining! I’m not. Padme just smiles, as Dorme laughs in the background.   PADME: I didn’t say it to hurt you.Anakin sighs and sits back on the bed.  ANAKIN: I know…A brief pause, then Padme walks over to Anakin. PADME: Anakin… don’t try to grow up too fast. Anakin gets up and meets her gaze, and the air between them becomes electric. They look deeply into each other’s eyes. ANAKIN: But I am grown up. You said it yourself. Padme blinks first. PADME: Please don’t look at me like that. ANAKIN: Why not? PADME: Because I can see what you’re thinking. ANAKIN: (half laugh) Ah…so you have Jedi powers too? Dorme looks at Padme with growing concern. PADME: It makes me feel uncomfortable. ANAKIN: (he doesn’t mean it) Sorry, M’Lady. Padme moves away from Anakin and continues packing. The Jedi apprentice has a sly smirk on his face. EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS -- DAYA small airbus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant’s industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes move supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes life cargo out of the starships. The bus stops before a huge, intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang. INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS -- DAYPadme and Anakin, dressed in Outland peasant clothing, get up and head for the door where Captain Typho, Dorme and Obi-Wan are waiting to hand them their luggage. TYPHO: Be safe, M’Lady.PADME: Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme...the threat’s on you two now. DORME: He’ll be safe with me.The group laughs. Dorme starts to weep as Padme tenderly embraces her surviving handmaiden in a fond farewell. PADME: You’ll be fine. DORME: It’s not me, M’Lady. I worry about you. What if they realize you’ve left the capitol…? PADME: Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is. Dorme laughs through her tears as Padme grins at Anakin. Obi-Wan notices the grin, and with a frown pulls Anakin aside and whispers. OBI-WAN: Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention to either yourself or the Senator. Don’t do anything without first consulting either myself or the Council. ANAKIN: Yes, Master. Obi-Wan looks at him uneasily, as if gauging his sincerity, but turns back to Padme. OBI-WAN: I’ll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M’Lady. You’ll be back here in no time. PADME: I’ll be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi. ANAKIN: It’s time to go. PADME: I know. Padme gives Dorme one last hug, as Anakin picks up the luggage. The two exit the speeder bus, where Artoo is waiting for them. OBI-WAN: Anakin, may the Force be with you.ANAKIN: May the Force be with you, Master. The two young people disappear into the spaceport with Artoo. PADME: Suddenly, I’m afraid…ANAKIN: This is my first assignment on my own. I am too. Padme is wide-eyed, but recovers quickly. ANAKIN: But don’t worry…we have Artoo with us. Artoo beeps in the affirmative as Padme laughs. Back at the speeder taxi, Obi-Wan continues to stare with worry at the spaceport. OBI-WAN: I do hope he doesn’t try anything foolish. TYPHO: I’d be more concerned about her doing something than him.  EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS, CORUSCANT -- DAYThe freighter slowly rises from the dock area, and shoots into the crowded sky.INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAYFrom high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. Obi-Wan crosses the floor of the great hallway, heading for the Analysis Rooms.INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAYObi-Wan walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A SP-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life, and a tray slides out of the console before the Jedi Master. SP-4: Place the subject for analysis on the sensor tray, please. Obi-Wan puts the dart onto the tray, which retracts into the console. The droid activates the system, and a screen lights up in front of Obi-Wan. OBI-WAN: It’s a toxic dart. I need to know where it came from and who made it. SP-4: One moment please… Diagrams and scan data appear on the console in a blur of speed as SP-4 whirs quietly to itself. Obi-Wan waits. Finally the screen goes blank, and the tray slides back out. SP-4: Markings cannot be identified. As you can see on your screen, subject weapon does not exist in any known culture. Probably self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society. Stand away from the sensor tray please. OBI-WAN: Excuse me? Could you try again, please?SP-4: Master Jedi, our records are very thorough. They cover eighty percent of the galaxy. If I can't tell you where it came from, nobody can.Obi-Wan frowns in frustration as he takes the dart.OBI-WAN: Thank you for your assistance. He thinks for a moment, then brightens. OBI-WAN: I know who can identify this…SP-4 gives an incredulous sniff as Obi-Wan walks off. IRIS IN:EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET -- MORNINGObi-Wan walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs thundering past. Above, the old elevated monospeed with occasional “shiny freighters” hissing through. Obi-Wan comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windows it says “Dex’s Diner,” in alien lettering. He goes inside. INT. CORUSCANT, DEX’S DINER -- MORNINGA WAITRESS DROID, WA-7, is carrying plates of half-eaten food. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating – TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS, ETC. The waitress droid looks up as Obi-Wan comes in.  WA-7: Can I help ya? OBI-WAN: I’m looking for Dexter. The waitress droid approaches Obi-Wan. WA-7: Waddya want him for? OBI-WAN: Relax – he’s not in trouble. It’s personal. There is a brief pause, then the droid goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter. WA-7: Someone to see ya, honey. (whisper) A Jedi by the looks of him. Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through. DEXTER JETTSTER: Obi-Wan!Obi-Wan grins like a schoolboy. OBI-WAN: Hello, Dex. DEXTER JETTSTER: Take a seat! I’ll be right with ya!Obi-Wan sits in a booth. WA-7: You want a cup of java juice? OBI-WAN: Oh yes, thank you.   The waitress droid moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big – bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely, and hugs Obi-Wan with three of his four arms – his other arm pulls his pants up. DEXTER JETTSTER: Hey, ol’ buddy!OBI-WAN: Hey, Dex. Dexter eases himself into the seat opposite Obi-Wan. With his huge girth, he can just make it.  DEXTER JETTSTER: So, my friend. What can I do for ya? OBI-WAN: You can tell me what this is. Obi-Wan places the dart on the table between them. Dex’s eyes widen, and he puts down his mug before he drinks it. DEXTER JETTSTER: (softly) Wow, waddya know…Dexter picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.DEXTER JETTSTER: I ain’t seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel, beyond the Outer Rim! OBI-WAN: Can you tell me where it came from? The waitress droid rolls up with Obi-Wan’s drink. OBI-WAN: (as he takes the drink) Thank you. Dexter grins and puts the dart down between them. DEXTER JETTSTER: I know exactly where it’s from. This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino saberdart. OBI-WAN: Kamino saberdart…I wonder why it didn’t show up in the analysis archives?  DEXTER JETTSTER: (indicates the dart) It’s these funny little cuts on the side that give it away. Those analysis droids you’ve got over there only focus on symbols, you know. Heh -- I should think that you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and…heh heh heh… wisdom.OBI-WAN: (smirk) Well Dex, if droids could think, there’d be none of us here, would there?  The two laugh. OBI-WAN: Kamino…I’m not familiar with it. Is it in the Republic? DEXTER JETTSTER: No no, it’s out beyond the Outer Rim. I’d say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze towards the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives. These, uh… Kaminoans keep to themselves. They’re cloners. Damned good ones, too. Obi-Wan picks up the dart, holding it midway between them. OBI-WAN: Cloners? Are they friendly?DEXTER JETTSTER: (mysterious smile) Oh, depends. OBI-WAN: Depends on what, Dex? Dexter’s grin grows wider. DEXTER JETTSTER: On how good your manners are…and how big your, uh, pocketbook is...Dex laughs heartily, as a smiling Obi-Wan looks down at the dart again. WIPE TO:INT. JEDI TEMPLE, JEDI HALL OF RECORDS – DAYThe bronze bust of an elderly bearded man stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. Obi-Wan stops in front of it, studying the striking features of the chiseled face. On the walls, lighted computer panels seemed to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, five Jedi are seated at tables, studying archival material.Obi-Wan studies the bust for a few moments before Madame JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist, comes up and stands next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi dressed in a yellow and brown robe. She’s tough as old boots and smart as a whip. JOCASTA NU: Did you call for assistance? OBI-WAN: (slightly distracted) Yes…yes, I did. Jocasta Nu notices the bust Obi-Wan’s studying. JOCASTA NU: He has a powerful face, doesn’t he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing. OBI-WAN: I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.JOCASTA NU: (sigh) “The Lost Twenty”… Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the order.OBI-WAN: What happened? JOCASTA NU: Well…Count Dooku was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council. Much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. OBI-WAN: (surprised) Really? JOCASTA NU: Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers, idealists… Jocasta Nu gazes at the bust as she speaks. JOCASTA NU: He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was…unique. (beat) In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.OBI-WAN: It’s very interesting. I’m not sure I completely understand.JOCASTA NU: Well, I’m sure you didn’t call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?Obi-Wan leads Jocasta over to the computer terminal he was working on.OBI-WAN: Yes. Um, I’m trying to find a planetary system called Kamino. It doesn’t show up in any of the archive charts. JOCASTA NU: Kamino? It’s not a system I’m familiar with. Let me see…Jocasta Nu leans over Obi-Wan’s shoulder, studying the screen closely. JOCASTA NU: Are you sure you have the right coordinates? OBI-WAN: (nods) According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here. Just south of the Rishi Maze. Jocasta Nu types some commands on the keyboard, and frowns at what she sees. JOCASTA NU: No coordinates? It sounds like the sort of directions you’d get from a street tout. Some old miner, or Furbog trader…OBI-WAN: (smiles) All three, actually. JOCASTA NU: Are you sure it exists?OBI-WAN: Absolutely. Jocasta grows more worried at what she sees on the monitor. JOCASTA NU: Let me do a gravitational scan… On the monitor, a star map hologram comes up. Several items blink up for attention. JOCASTA NU: Hmm. There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you’re seeking was destroyed. OBI-WAN: Wouldn’t that be on record? JOCASTA NU: It ought to be, unless it was very recent. (types some more, then shakes her head) I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you’re searching for doesn’t exist. OBI-WAN: Impossible…perhaps the archives are incomplete. JOCASTA NU: (archly) The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!With an arrogant sniff, Jocasta Nu turns and notices a young boy approach. She walks away from Obi-Wan and leaves with the youngster. Obi-Wan stares at her, then looks back to the map.EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER The massive, slow-moving Freighter moves through space.INT. STARFREIGHTER , STEERAGE HOLD -- DAYThe dark lower hold of the starfreighter is packed with emigrants of all shapes, sizes and races. Artoo rolls through the heavy crowds towards a food line at one end of the hold. With two tiny claws that shoot out from his side, Artoo picks up two empty bowls and joins the line. At the beginning of the line, the cooks are ladling mush into bowls for the passengers. SERVER DROID: Keep moving, keep moving…Artoo then moves down the line, extending a small straw into one of the tubs of mush at the bar. With the straw, the little droid sucks a huge amount of the mush. Another claw comes out of the droid’s side and it takes up a few rolls of bread. The server droid glowers at little Artoo. SERVER DROID: HEY YOU!! NO DROIDS!! GET OUTTA HERE!!With an “Excuse me” set of beeps, Artoo takes one last suck at the mush and rolls away from the line with the two bowls and the bread rolls as the server droid shouts after him.  The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping emigrants including Sullustans, Aqualish, Ishi Tib and other species. He comes to where Anakin is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare and is very restless.ANAKIN: n…no…mom, no…The Jedi apprentice is covered in sweat as he tosses and turns. Padme leans over him and starts to wipe the sweat away from his brow, and Anakin awakens with a start. ANAKIN: Wha--??Artoo hands Padme the two bowls. Extending the straw again, it begins to dispense mush from its’ body into the bowls like a beer tap. PADME: You seemed to be having a nightmare. Anakin stares at Padme, wondering how much of his nightmare she overheard. She hands him one of the bowls and a bread roll. PADME: Are you hungry? ANAKIN: (quickly) Yeah. He pulls himself up, and the two sit across the bunk and use it as a small table. ANAKIN: Thanks. PADME: Thank you, Artoo. Artoo beeps happily and rolls away. PADME: We went to lightspeed a while ago. ANAKIN: I’m looking forward to seeing Naboo again. I’ve thought about it every day since I left. It’s by far the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen…His eyes never leave Padme as he speaks. The intensity of his stare unnerves her, and she concentrates on her food. PADME: You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it. Time changes perception. ANAKIN: Sometimes it does. Sometimes for the better. Padme is growing very uncomfortable with this talk. As Anakin eats, she tries to change the subject. PADME: It must be difficult, having sworn your life to the Jedi. Not being able to visit the places you like…or do the things you like…ANAKIN: …or be with the people that I love. PADME: Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi. ANAKIN: Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion – which I would define as unconditional love – is central to a Jedi’s life. So you might say that…we are encouraged to love. PADME: (smiles wistfully) You have changed so much…ANAKIN: You haven’t changed a bit. You’re exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.Padme blushes. ANAKIN: I doubt if Naboo has changed much either. PADME: It hasn’t – ANAKIN: (stepping over her words) I can’t wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualize the Force, those hills are what I see. (pause) I love Naboo. Another awkward moment. Anakin’s words say he loves Naboo, but his intent stare at Padme says something else entirely. Padme again tries to change the topic. PADME: You were dreaming about your mother earlier, weren’t you? ANAKIN: (quiet) Yes. It’s true. (looks down) I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don’t want to lose it. Recently I’ve been seeing her in my dreams. Vivid dreams. (beat, then whisper) Scary dreams. I worry about her…Padme gives a small, sympathetic smile.PADME: I’d be disappointed if you didn’t. You didn’t leave her in the best of circumstances. Anakin winces. Padme puts her hand on his forearm. PADME: Trust me, Anakin…you did the right thing in going. For yourself, but more importantly, for your mother. Anakin can’t argue with that. INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY – DAYObi-Wan walks through the main hallway of the Jedi Temple to the training area. INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA -- DAYObi-Wan comes out onto the veranda and stops. He watches twenty or so four year olds of various races doing training exercises, supervised by Jedi Master Yoda. The younglings wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little training droids with their miniature lightsabers. The droids dance in front of them. YODA: Reach out and sense the Force around you. Use your feelings, you must. Yoda notices Obi-Wan and taps the ground with his cane. YODA: Younglings – Younglings, enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.The children take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers. The training droids float up to the ceiling, out of sight. YODA: Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.CHILDREN: Hello, Master Obi-Wan!OBI-WAN: Hello. (to Yoda) I am sorry to disturb you, Master.YODA: What help can I be, Obi-Wan? Hmm? OBI-WAN: I’m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the systems don’t show in the archive maps.YODA: Hmm. Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing, how embarrassing...One of the children smothers a giggle. YODA: Liam, the shades. An interesting puzzle… One of the children, LIAM, closes the shades. YODA: Gather around the map reader. Clear your minds, and find Obi-Wan’s wayward planet we will. Bobby, the lights please…BOBBY turns off the lights, casting the room into darkness. Yoda gathers the younglings around the map reader. The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The children gather around it. Obi-Wan takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The children laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. Obi-Wan walks into the display. OBI-WAN: (pointing) It ought to be…here… but it isn’t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot. YODA: Most interesting… Gravity’s silhouette remains, but the star and all the planets…disappeared, they have. How can this be?Yoda turns to the class. YODA: Now younglings…in your mind, what is the first thing you see? An answer, hmm? A thought? Anyone? There is a brief pause. Then a child puts its hand up. Yoda nods.JK BURTOLA: Master? Because someone erased it from the archive memory.CHILDREN: That’s right! Yes! That’s what happened! Someone erased it!MARI AMITHEST: (another of the children) If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.YODA: (chuckles) Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. The Padawan is right – go to the center of gravity’s pull, and find your planet you will.Yoda and Obi-Wan move away from the children. With a hand movement, Obi-Wan causes the star map to disappear. He uses the Force to call the glass ball back to his hand as the two walk into an adjoining room. YODA: Hmm…the data must have been erased. OBI-WAN: But Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives? That’s impossible, isn’t it?YODA: (frowns) Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why…harder to answer. Meditate on this, I will. May the Force be with you. Obi-Wan bows and walks off as Yoda walks back toward the children.EXT. ANOTHER LANDING PLATFORM – DAYObi-Wan’s red-and-white Delta-7 starfighter is ready for takeoff. Obi-Wan and Mace Windu stand beside it.MACE WINDU: Be wary, the disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.Obi-Wan nods…then sighs with worry. OBI-WAN: Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I’m afraid Anakin won’t be able to protect the Senator.MACE WINDU: Why?OBI-WAN: He has a… an emotional connection with her. It’s been there since he was a boy. Now he is confused, distracted...MACE WINDU: Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path.Obi-Wan then climbs into the cockpit of his starfighter. Mace smiles and waves. MACE WINDU: May the Force be with you.OBI-WAN: (to his droid) Set course for the hyperspace ring, Arfour. Mace steps back as the Jedi Starfighter warms up and lifts off into the sky.WIPE TO:EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT  – DAYThe starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed. Among the departing passengers are Anakin and Padme (dressed as peasants) and Artoo. They head over to the main plaza where they board a speeder bus. EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD -- AFTERNOONThe speeder bus pulls up and stops at the Grand Courtyard of Theed, and Anakin, Padme and Artoo get out. Anakin stares out at the wide, beautiful courtyard in wonder. The great courtyard stretches before them, and they see the rose-colored domes of the palace on the far side. Artoo whistles. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. Artoo trundles behind them. ANAKIN: If I grew up here, I don’t think I’d ever leave. PADME: (laughs) I doubt that. ANAKIN: No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about… (beat) The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace. The way it shimmers in the sunlight. The way the air always smells of flowers…PADME: (wistful) …and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the capitol, I was very young. I’d never seen a waterfall before. I thought they were so beautiful…I never dreamed one day I’d live in the palace. ANAKIN: Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?PADME: (laughing) No! That was the last thing I thought of. But the more history I studied, the more I realized how much good politicians could do. After school I became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that before I knew it I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. (beat) I wasn’t the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I’m not sure I was old enough. I’m not sure I was ready.ANAKIN: The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they even tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.Padme frowns at this. PADME: Popular rule is not democracy, Ani. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up.She looks down at the ground in contemplation.  PADME: So were my parents. They worried about me during the blockade and couldn’t wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now… (grins at Anakin) My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids… but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn’t refuse her.ANAKIN: I agree with her! I think the Republic needs you… I’m glad that you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.PADME: I think so too.Anakin and Padme walk toward the palace. Artoo continues to follow. INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM -- AFTERNOONQUEEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors. Outside the throne room, Artoo waits. QUEEN JAMILLIA: We’ve been worried about you. (takes Padme’s hand) I’m so glad you’re safe, Padme. PADME: Thank you, your Highness. I only wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote. SIO BIBBLE: Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has explained it all. Given the circumstances, Senator, returning home was the only real choice you could have made. Padme gives Bibble a resigned nod. QUEEN JAMILLIA: How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?PADME: Thousands. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I’m sure it’s going to push us into a civil war. Both Jamillia and Sio are shaken by this. SIO BIBBLE: It’s unthinkable! There hasn’t been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!QUEEN JAMILLIA: Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?PADME: Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don’t have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I’m sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Trade Federation or the Commerce Guilds for help.QUEEN JAMILLIA: The armies of commerce! Why has nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?!? PADME: I’m afraid that, despite the Chancellor’s best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds. SIO BIBBLE: It’s outrageous that after all of those hearings and four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the Senate is powerless to resolve this crisis. Do those money mongers control everything?QUEEN JAMILLIA: Remember, Counselor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation’s armies. (beat) That’s a move in the right direction.PADME: (winces) There are rumors, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.ANAKIN: The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It was… considered to be too dangerous for the economy.QUEEN JAMILLIA: (smiles) We must keep our faith in the Republic. The Queen rises from her throne, and everyone else rises with her. She crosses over to Padme. QUEEN JAMILLIA: The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.PADME: Let’s pray that day never comes.QUEEN JAMILLIA: In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.Anakin, Padme, the Queen, and Bibble walk towards the open throne room doors. The handmaidens trail along behind them. SIO BIBBLE: What is your suggestion, Master Jedi? PADME: Oh, Anakin’s not a Jedi yet. He’s still a Padawan Learner. (To Jamillia) But I was thinking – ANAKIN: Hey, hold on a minute…PADME: (stern look at Anakin) Excuse me! (back to Jamillia) I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. ANAKIN: Excuse me! I am in charge of security here, M’Lady!!The tension between the two fills the room. Bibble and Jamillia look at each other with worry. PADME: Ani, my life is at risk. And this is my home. I know it very well, that is why we’re here. I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance. Anakin takes a deep breath and forces a polite smile, though his eyes still blaze with anger. ANAKIN: Sorry, M’Lady. SIO BIBBLE: (half amused) She’s right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people, and a clear view of the surrounding terrain. QUEEN JAMILLIA: Perfect. It’s settled then. Padme, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave – your family’s very worried about you…PADME: Thank you, your Highness. Padme looks worried as she and Jamillia walk out of the throne room and down a staircase. Anakin and Bibble follow them. EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET – AFTERNOONPEOPLE are passing through a small street of Theed. OLD MEN are sunning themselves, WOMEN are gossiping, KIDS are playing. Anakin, Padme and Artoo turn onto a side street. Anakin is back in his Jedi robes and holding Padme’s luggage. Padme is wearing a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.PADME: There's my house!Padme starts forward; Anakin hangs back.PADME: What? Don't say you're shy!ANAKIN: (untruthfully) No, but I --Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward Padme.RYOO & POOJA: Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!PADME: Ryoo!! Pooja!!Padme scoops up Ryoo and Pooja and hugs them.PADME: I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.Anakin and the girls say hello to each, both shyly. Then:PADME: Go wake up Artoo. RYOO & POOJA: ARTOO!!As they see the droid, they run up and hug him. Artoo whistles and beeps with happiness. Padme laughs, and she and Anakin go on toward the house. The girls stay and play with little Artoo.INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM (NABOO) - AFTERNOONSOLA, Padme's beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.SOLA: (over her shoulder) They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine.Sola puts the bowl down on the table, where Anakin, Padme and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.SOLA: Padme! (hugging her) You’re late. Mom was worried. PADME: We walked. Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.SOLA: Hello, Anakin.ANAKIN: Hello.Sola sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.PADME: And this is my mother. JOBAL: You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, Anakin.ANAKIN: A little.PADME: He's being polite, Mom. We're starving.RUWEE: (grinning) You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son.Everyone sits and starts passing food.JOBAL: (to Padme) Honey, it's so good to see you safe. We were so worried.Padme gives her mother a dirty look. Ruwee smiles as he watches.RUWEE: Dear...JOBAL: I know, I know... but I had to say it. Now it's done.SOLA: Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?Padme blanches, and rolls her eyes at her sister. PADME: So-la!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.JOVAL: A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme, they didn't tell us it was that serious…PADME: It's not, Mom, I promise. (glances at Jobal) Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?They nod.PADME: (wryly) He grew up.JOBAL: Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!PADME: Mom, I'm not in any danger.RUWEE: (to Anakin) Is she?Anakin hesitates.				ANAKIN: Yes. I'm afraid she is.PADME: (quickly) But not much.EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOONAnakin and Ruwee are walking.RUWEE: Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more... but I must say, I'm happy here.ANAKIN: Padme tells me you teach at the university?RUWEE: (nodding) Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement when I was very young.ANAKIN: You seem quite interested in public service. RUWEE: Naboo is generous. We have all that we want, all that we could want. Food is plentiful, climate is comfortable, surroundings are – ANAKIN: Beautiful. RUWEE: Quite so. We are a very fortunate people, and we know it. That good fortune shouldn’t be taken for granted, so we try to share and try to help. In doing so, we become something larger than ourselves, and more fulfilled than one can become from idly enjoying good fortune. ANAKIN: It’s the same with the Jedi, I suppose. We’ve been given great gifts, and we train hard to make the most of them. And then we use our powers to try to help the galaxy, to make everything a little bit better. RUWEE: And to make the things we love a little bit safer. Anakin smiles and nods. Ruwee looks at him with gratitude and respect. INT. NABERRIE LAKE RETREAT– DINING ROOM -- DAYPadme, Sola, and Jobal are clearing the table. SOLA: Why haven't you told us about him?PADME: What's there to talk about? He's just a boy. SOLA: A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?PADME: Sola, stop it! SOLA: It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed?PADME: I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends… our relationship is strictly professional. Sola gives a knowing “Sure it is” grin. PADME: Mom, would you tell her to stop it?SOLA: (laughing) Well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.PADME: Cut it out!!JOBAL: Sola's just concerned…we all are. PADME: Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.JOBAL: You've done your service, Padme. It's time you had a life of your own. You're missing so much!EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN (NABOO) - AFTERNOONRuwee pauses in his walk, and Anakin stops as well. RUWEE: Now tell me, son…how serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in? ANAKIN: (hesitantly) There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there’ll be more. Ruwee is pained to hear this. ANAKIN: My master is tracking down the assassins, I’m sure he’ll find out who they are. This situation won’t last long. Ruwee nods, sadly. RUWEE: I don’t want anything to happen to her…ANAKIN: I don’t either.  INT. NABERRIE LAKE RETREAT– DINING ROOM -- DAYPadme and Sola are now alone in the room. Padme stares at her older sister with some exasperation. SOLA: What? PADME: Why do you keep saying such things about me and Anakin? SOLA: Because it’s obvious. You see it – you can’t deny it. Padme sighs. SOLA: I thought Jedi weren’t supposed to think such things. You think more like a Jedi than he does – and you shouldn’t. PADME: What do you mean? SOLA: You’re so tied up in your responsibilities that you don’t give any weight to your desires. PADME: You don’t know how I feel about Anakin. SOLA: And neither do you – because you won’t let yourself think about it. It’s funny – you act as if you’re prohibited and you’re not, while Anakin acts as if he’s under no such prohibitions, and he is! PADME: You’re way ahead of everything! Anakin and I have only been together for a few days – before that, I hadn’t seen him in a decade! Sola shrugs and puts an arm around Padme’s shoulder. SOLA: I know how he feels. And so do you. Padme gazes down at the floor, troubled. Sola lifts her chin and makes Padme face her. SOLA: It frightens you. What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of his feelings…or of your own? (beat) You’re right, I don’t know how you feel. But I suspect that it’s something new to you. Something scary…but something wonderful. Padme can’t answer that.INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOONPadme throws some things into a bag.PADME: Don't worry, this won't take long.ANAKIN: I just want to get there before dark.Padme goes on packing, and Anakin looks around the room.ANAKIN: You still live at home.PADME: I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.ANAKIN: I never had a real home. Home was always where my mom was.Anakin picks up a framed hologram and shows it to her.ANAKIN: Is this you?The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.PADME: That was when I went with a relief group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means “sweetheart.” He was so full of life... All those kids were. (somber) I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt. To live off their native planet.Anakin picks up another hologram. It shows Padme at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.PADME: My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?Padme pulls a face, and Anakin grins. She continues packing. Anakin sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the stern, unsmiling adolescent.WIPE TO: EXT. SPACE – NEAR KAMINOThe view is just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship leaps out of hyperspace and disengages from the hyperspace transport ring. The starship, painted red-and-white and wedge-shaped, flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACEObi-Wan sits in the starship’s cockpit, wearing a headset. He studies the console readouts. OBI-WAN: There it is, Arfour, right where it should be. Our missing planet, Kamino. Those files were altered. On the side of the ship, a red-and-white ARFOUR DROID beeps in worry. EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAYHeavy rains and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan’s Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world. The Starfighter lands. Obi-Wan gets out and makes his way through the howling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. Obi-Wan passes through it and goes inside. INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE -- DAY Brilliant white light. Obi-Wan pushes the soaking hood from his face. TAUN WE: Master Jedi, so good to see you. Welcome to Tipoca City.OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. She has large almond shaped eyes, and speaks with a slow, melodic singsong voice.TAUN WE: Everything is ready. The Prime Minister is expecting you.OBI-WAN: (warily) I'm expected?!?TAUN WE: Of course! He is anxious to meet you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way…INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE – DAYThe door slides open. Obi-Wan and Taun We enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises smiling from his chair, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.TAUN WE: May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino. And this is Master Jedi – OBI-WAN: Obi-Wan Kenobi. LAMA SU: Please…Lama Su gestures to a seat, which Obi-Wan does not take. Lama Su sits as well, while Taun We hovers beside him. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech. LAMA SU: I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season. OBI-WAN: You make me feel most welcome. LAMA SU: (indicates the chair again) Please…? Obi-Wan finally sits down.LAMA SU: And now to business: You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with a million more well on the way. Obi-Wan is lost, but improvises as best he can. OBI-WAN: That’s…good news. LAMU SU: Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas that his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope.OBI-WAN: I’m sorry? Master – ?LAMU SU: Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?Obi-Wan is visibly puzzled. OBI-WAN: Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago. LAMA SU: Oh. I’m so sorry to hear that. But I’m sure he would have been proud of the army we’ve built for him. OBI-WAN: The army…!?LAMA SU: Yes – a clone army. And I must say, one of the finest we’ve ever created. OBI-WAN: (thinking furiously) Tell me, Prime Minister… when my Master first contacted you about the army, did-did he say who it was for? LAMA SU: Of course he did. The army is for the Republic. Obi-Wan is visibly rocked by this. Lama Su stands up. LAMA SU: But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself. OBI-WAN: (grins and shrugs) That’s why I’m here. Obi-Wan and Lama Su rise and walk toward the door. EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOONA water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, docks at an island landing platform. Anakin and Padme disembark the water speeder at the base of a lodge rising on the beautiful island in the middle of the lake. EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACE -- LATE AFTERNOONAnakin and Padme walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto the garden terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, Paddy Accu follows. Anakin and Padme stop at the balustrade. Padme looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. Anakin looks at her. PADME: When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water. ANAKIN: I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.Padme suddenly becomes aware that Anakin is looking only at her. PADME: We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us, and try to guess the names of the birds singing.ANAKIN: I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here…Anakin touches Padme’s arm, caressing it. Padme’s intensely uncomfortable, but starting to like the attention in spite of herself. ANAKIN: Here everything’s soft… and smooth…PADME: There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand – and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.ANAKIN: Everything here is magical.Padme keeps trying to avoid his gaze, but Anakin keeps bringing her eyes to meet his. PADME: You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real… but it wasn’t.ANAKIN: Sometimes…when you believe something to be real… it becomes real. Anakin flashes a dazzling, heart-melting smile. But Padme forces herself to continue with her story.PADME: I used to think… if you looked too deeply into glass…you would lose yourself. ANAKIN: I think it’s true. Slowly, tenderly, he kisses her. She doesn’t resist… at first. She pulls away after a moment. PADME: No. I shouldn’t have done that…ANAKIN: I’m sorry…He stares at the lake, a bewildered “what did I do wrong” look on his face. INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY – DAYObi-Wan is led by Lama Su and Taun We through a transparent glass tunnel to a vast clone hatchery all around them, where thousands upon thousands of translucent tubes can be seen, sticking out from the floor and ceiling at all angles, and an embryonic form in each of them. OBI-WAN: Very impressive.LAMA SU: I’d hoped you would be pleased. Clones can think creatively. You’ll find that they are immensely superior to droids.Obi-Wan gazes at the nearest embryos.OBI-WAN: How many are there…? LAMA SU: We have several hatcheries throughout the city. This, of course, is the most crucial phase – though with our techniques, we expect a survival rate of over ninety percent. Every so often, an entire batch will develop a…an issue, but we expect production to remain steady, and with our accelerated growth methods, these before you will be fully matured and ready for battle in just over a decade. Obi-Wan can’t suppress a shudder. Lama Su gestures far below the tunnel at a distant classroom. Inside, a group of small identical ten-year-old boys in blue outfits sit at desks and rapidly move complex puzzles into completion in mere seconds. There are patches on each of the children’s shoulders. LAMA SU: We take great pride in our combat education and training programs. This group was created about five years ago. OBI-WAN: You mentioned growth acceleration...LAMA SU: Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. The items you will soon see on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sifo-Dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature...Lama Su points down at a large eating area. Seated and eating at tables are HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all physically about twenty years old, dressed in red outfits. They also have patches on their shoulders.  OBI-WAN: I see. LAMA SU: You’ll find they are totally obedient, taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. The trio continue to walk down the glass tunnel. OBI-WAN: And who was the original host?LAMA SU: A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sifo-Dyas handpicked Jango Fett himself.Obi-Wan notes the words “bounty hunter,” but keeps his expression neutral. OBI-WAN: And where is this bounty hunter now?LAMA SU: Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.The tour continues through a long corridor filled with narrow, transparent tubes into which clones are climbing. Once in the tube, the clone goes to sleep. The other side of the tunnel looks out upon a vast training area when clones of various ages go through rigorous martial arts matches.OBI-WAN: Very disciplined. LAMA SU: That is the key. Disciplined, and yet able to think creatively. It is a mighty combination. Sifo-Dyas explained to us the Jedi aversion to leading droids. He told us Jedi could only command an army of life forms. OBI-WAN: So this Jango Fett willingly lives here? LAMA SU: The choice is his alone. Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn't it?OBI-WAN: Unaltered?The tour now moves over a vast grouping of lines. Several hundred adult clones, now in white armor, move to a conveyor belt where white helmets are rolling along. Each clone takes a helmet, dons it, and moves out. LAMA SU: Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...OBI-WAN: I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.TAUN WE: I would be very happy to arrange it for you.Finally the tunnel ends, and Obi-Wan, Lama Su and Taun We come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS can be seen below, and each are wielding a blaster rifle. They move in perfect military formation, entire formations moving as one, in a stunning parade of might despite the pouring rain. LAMA SU: (beaming) Magnificent, aren’t they? Obi-Wan nods slowly. He is both awed and terrified at the sight before him.EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW – LATE AFTERNOONPadme and Anakin are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly. Beyond is the shimmering expanse of waterfalls of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. Padme is picking flowers. PADME: I don’t know…ANAKIN: Sure you do. You just don’t want to tell me. PADME: Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?ANAKIN: They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.PADME: All right…I was twelve. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older than I… very cute. Dark curly hair. Dreamy eyes. ANAKIN: All right, I get the picture…whatever happened to him? PADME: I went into public service. He went on to become an artist. ANAKIN: Maybe he was the smart one. PADME: (thoughtful) You really don’t like politicians, do you? Anakin shrugs. ANAKIN: I like two or three, but I’m not really sure about one of them. Padme giggles. ANAKIN: I don’t think the system works. PADME: How would you have it work? ANAKIN: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.PADME: That’s exactly what we do. Th-the trouble is that people don't always agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.ANAKIN: Then they should be made to.PADME: By whom? Who's going to make them?ANAKIN: I don't know. Someone.	PADME: You?				ANAKIN: Of course not me.PADME: But someone.ANAKIN: Someone wise.	PADME: Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.ANAKIN: Well… if it works…She stares at him, confused. Anakin can’t keep a straight face, and finally grins. Padme busts out laughing. PADME: (laughs) You’re making fun of me! ANAKIN: (grinning) Oh no, I’d be much too frightened to tease a Senator.PADME: You’re so bad! She picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. Padme throws two more, and he catches them both. ANAKIN: You’re always so serious…PADME: I’m so serious?!?Anakin then starts to juggle the fruit. Padme laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too. She throws more and more until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.Anakin then gets up and stands in front of a Shaak, yelling at it and waving his arms. Padme starts laughing as Anakin runs in circles, chased by the Shaak.EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW, LATE AFTERNOONThe Shaak crosses in front of Padme. Anakin is now standing on top of it, riding on its back. The Shaak bucks, and Anakin falls off. Padme laughs even harder. Anakin lies still, face down in the grass. Padme’s smile fades. PADME: Ani – ANI!! Are you all right? She jumps up and runs to where Anakin is lying and turns him over. He is laughing at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. They stop with Padme lying on top of Anakin. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.Anakin stands up and holds out his hand to her. She takes it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. Padme scrambles up onto the Shaak behind Anakin. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. Anakin digs his heels in. The Shaak starts forward, and they ride away.EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) – DAYRain lashes the city. Below, mighty waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms. A large avian carrying a rain-soaked rider bursts out of the sea and flies above the water toward a floating city. INT. JANGO FETT’S APARTMENT (KAMINO) – DAYObi-Wan and Taun We arrive at an apartment. Taun We waves her hand, and a muted bell rings. As they wait, Obi-Wan notes the lock mechanism on the door. Then the door slides open to reveal a young ten-year-old boy identical to the ones in the classroom before – identical, that is, except for his sharper, more aware expression.TAUN WE: Boba, is your father here?There is a brief pause.BOBA FETT: Yep. TAUN WE: May we see him?BOBA FETT: Sure.Another brief pause, then Boba Fett steps aside, and Taun We and Obi-Wan go through.INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT -- DAYObi-Wan, Taun We and Boba Fett enter the apartment. Obi-Wan looks around the room. BOBA FETT: Dad, Taun We’s here! JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with the scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms.  He eyes Obi-Wan with suspicion.TAUN WE: Jango, welcome back. Was your trip productive? JANGO FETT: Fairly. Obi-Wan and Jango Fett size each other up. Boba notices this and studies the two closely. TAUN WE: This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. He’s come to check on our progress. JANGO FETT: That right…? Jango Fett’s eyes fix Obi-Wan coldly. OBI-WAN: Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud. JANGO FETT: (shrug) I’m just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi. OBI-WAN: Aren’t we all? Obi-Wan finally gives up the staredown and looks around the apartment. His gaze falls upon the half-open bedroom door…and beyond it, scraps of some very familiar body armor. Jango smoothly puts himself between Obi-Wan and the door. OBI-WAN: (pointedly) Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant? JANGO FETT: Once or twice. OBI-WAN: Recently? JANGO FETT: Possibly. Jango’s maintaining a perfect poker face, with a hint of a smile. OBI-WAN: Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas?JANGO FETT: (in Huttese) Boba, close the door. (back to Obi-Wan) Master who? Boba Fett moves in to close the bedroom door. OBI-WAN: Sifo-Dyas. Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job? JANGO FETT: Never heard of him. OBI-WAN: Really. JANGO FETT: I was recruited by a man called Tyranus, on one of the moons of Bogden. OBI-WAN: No? I thought --TAUN WE: Sifo-Dyas told us to expect him, and he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the Jedi’s involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your master requested…Obi-Wan is even more concerned at this. OBI-WAN: Curious…JANGO FETT: Do you like your army?OBI-WAN: I look forward to seeing them in action.  JANGO FETT: (smirk) They’ll do their job well, I’ll guarantee that. OBI-WAN: Thank you for your time, Jango. JANGO FETT: Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi. Obi-Wan and Taun We leave. The door slides closed. Jango looks over at Boba thoughtfully. BOBA FETT: What is it, Dad?JANGO FETT: Pack your things. We’re leaving. Boba starts to reply – JANGO FETT: NOW!!Boba almost trips over himself rushing into the bedroom. EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE -- LATE AFTERNOONThe setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floating lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge. INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOONNANDI places dessert in front of Padme. TECKLA does the same for Anakin. The dessert is some kind of fruit. ANAKIN: And when I got to them, we went into…aggressive negotiations. (to Teckla) Thank you. PADME: “Aggressive negotiations.” What’s that? ANAKIN: Uh, well…negotiations with a lightsaber. PADME: (laughing) Oh. Padme picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again - the fruit moves. She looks up at Anakin. His eyes are focused on his plate.PADME: You did that?Anakin looks up - wide-eyed innocence.ANAKIN: What?Padme scowls at him and jabs at the fruit - Anakin subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her!PADME: That! Now stop it!The two laugh. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.PADME: Anakin!!Anakin moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.ANAKIN: I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy.Grinning, Anakin cuts the fruit into several pieces and sends one back to Padme. She spears it out of the air with her fork and takes a bite out of it. A warm, childlike smile brightens Anakin’s face. INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHTA fire blazes in the open hearth. Padme is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.She looks up as Anakin arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.ANAKIN: May I tell you something?PADME: I don't know.ANAKIN: Then how can I tell you?PADME: Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.ANAKIN: It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.PADME: (sighs) Anakin, no...Anakin can’t stop now. The words rush out in a torrent. ANAKIN: From the moment I met you, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again, I'm in agony. Anakin’s voice begins to quiver. ANAKIN: The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. Th-the thought of not being with you makes my stomach turn over – my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...Silence. The logs flame in the hearth. Padme meets his eye, then looks away. ANAKIN: If you are suffering as much as I am, please tell me…PADME: (voice shaking) I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.ANAKIN: Anything is possible, Padme. Listen to me –Padme gets up quickly and puts distance between herself and Anakin.PADME: No, you listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight, I'm…I’m a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, it’ll take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.ANAKIN: Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.PADME: Ani, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to love. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities, your future, for me.ANAKIN: (gets up) I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you’re asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings... but I can't.PADME: I will not give into this!! I'm not going to throw my life away!! I have more important things to do… than fall in love…Silence. Anakin turns away from her and walks off a bit, thinking.ANAKIN: But… well, you know….it wouldn't have to be that way. We could keep it a secret.PADME: We'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. My sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?Silence for a moment. Then Anakin sadly nods. ANAKIN: No. You're right. It would destroy us.WIPE TO: EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) – LATE DAYEstablishing overhead shot of the floating city. INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR – DAYObi-Wan stands with Taun We and Lama Su just inside the open door. LAMA SU: Tell your Council that the first battalions are ready. And remind them if they need more troops, it will take more time to grow them. OBI-WAN: I won’t forget. And thank you. TAUN WE: Thank you. EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – LATE DAYObi-Wan comes out from the tower into the driving rain. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale. Obi-Wan glances back toward the closed door, confirming that Lama Su has left. Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform to where Obi-Wan is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then addresses Arfour.OBI-WAN: Arfour? EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER (RAINSTORM) – LATE DAYR4-P17, Obi-Wan’s Astro-Droid, who is still sitting on top of Obi-Wan’s Starfighter, switches on and beeps. OBI-WAN: Arfour, relay this, "scramble code five," to Coruscant: care of "the old folks home."Arfour beeps and whistles. The panels light up inside the cockpit. A transmitter dish emerges from the top of the starfighter and the message is transmitted.INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA’S QUARTERS – LATE AFTERNOONYoda and Mace Windu listen as a hologram of Obi-Wan (out in the rain by his starfighter) stands between them broadcasting the massage. The signal is very weak, the image fades in and out.OBI-WAN: (V.O.) I have successfully made contact with the Prime Minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we’re looking for.MACE WINDU: Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala? OBI-WAN: (V.O.) No, Master. There appears to be no motive.YODA: Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot. OBI-WAN: (V.O.) Yes, Master. They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for the clone army at the request of the Senate almost ten years ago. Yoda and Mace Windu glance at each other in surprise. OBI-WAN: I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the Council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?MACE WINDU: No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council, I can assure you.YODA: Into custody take this Jango Fett. Bring him here -- question him, we will. OBI-WAN: (V.O.) Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him. May the Force... The hologram switches off, and Obi-Wan fades away. MACE WINDU: A clone army?!? Why would Sifo-Dyas…YODA: When placed this order was may provide insight. MACE WINDU: If this Jango Fett was involved in trying to kill the Senator…and just happened to be chosen as the source for a clone army created for the Republic…He shakes his head, completely baffled. YODA: Blind we are, if the creation of this clone army we could not see. Mace sighs heavily and lowers his head. MACE WINDU: (quietly) I think it is time we informed the Senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished. YODA: Only the Dark Lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the Senate is, multiply our adversaries will.INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHTAnakin moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.ANAKIN: no...No...MOM!!! No, don't..!!!His eyes snap open. It takes a long moment for him to calm down. CROSSFADE TO: EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS – MORNINGPadme quietly enters Anakin's room to find him on the balcony. He stands facing the rising sun, eyes closed, hands behind his back. Not wanting to interrupt him, she turns to leave. ANAKIN: (eyes closed) Don’t go.PADME: I don’t want to disturb you.ANAKIN: Your presence is soothing.A brief pause. Padme hesitantly walks up to him. PADME: You had another nightmare last night. ANAKIN: Jedi don’t have nightmares. PADME: I heard you. Another beat. Anakin slowly opens his eyes and looks at her. ANAKIN: I saw my mother. She is suffering, Padme. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. He turns away, letting out a shaky sigh.ANAKIN: She is in pain…They’re killing her… His face stricken with grief and worry, he turns back to face Padme. ANAKIN: I know I’m disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished, and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order. But I have to go. I have to help her. PADME: (gently) Ani…I told you I wouldn’t let you give up your future for me. I’ll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won’t be disobeying your mandate. ANAKIN: I don’t think this is what the Jedi Council had in mind. I fear I’m walking into danger, and to take you with me – PADME: Walking into danger. (half laugh) A place I’ve never been before. ANAKIN: What about Master Obi-Wan? She smiles gently and takes his hand. PADME: I guess we won’t tell him, will we? Anakin winces at her kind words and expression. ANAKIN: I’m sorry, I don’t have a choice…INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR -- DAYObi-Wan enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it. INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FETT APARTMENT -- DAYObi-Wan arrives at the door to Jango Fett’s apartment. He reaches up and runs his fingers along the door, locating the locks. The door slides open. INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT -- DAYObi-Wan walks in to find the room is in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide-open – clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts’ personal belongings are gone. Obi-Wan goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up an onscreen picture of Jango Fett and Boba Fett unhitching the lines securing their ship on the landing platform. Jango Fett is wearing his blue-and-silver armor and rocket pack. EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAYJango Fett’s ship, Slave I, rests on the landing platform. Jango and Boba Fett are preparing to board. JANGO FETT: Yeah, I’ll let you fly it. Boba punches a fist into the air in triumph. JANGO FETT: Not to take her out though. We’re going out hot, son, but we’ll take her back out of lightspeed early so you can get some time working her about. Boba nods, hoists another bag and starts up the ship’s ramp. His eyes suddenly go wide. BOBA FETT: Dad, look!Jango turns from his son to see Obi-Wan charging out of the tower at him, drawing and igniting his lightsaber as he does.  JANGO FETT: BOBA, GET ONBOARD!!Jango then opens fire with one blaster as Boba scrambles up the ramp. Obi-Wan deflects the bolts. As Jango continues firing, he moves behind and around pillars. Obi-Wan shuffles while deflecting the bolts. As Jango moves behind a pillar, Obi-Wan charges forward. Jango then unholsters a second blaster and begins firing with both weapons. Obi-Wan has trouble deflecting the barrage of bolts. Jango takes off (using his jetpack) over the top of Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan swings his lightsaber in attempt to take Jango down, but misses. As he is flying past, Jango pivots in the air and fires down at Obi-Wan from a high angle. Obi-Wan deflects the bolts from above. Jango continues to fire with both blasters as he flies away from Obi-Wan. Under the barrage of two blasters, Obi-Wan struggles to deflect every bolt. He then rolls off to the side to avoid the bolts as Jango flies off behind a tower. OBI-WAN: You’re coming with me, Jango!Emerging on the top of the tower, Jango fires a rocket that is protruding from the top of his jetpack. Obi-Wan avoids the explosion, but is sent sprawling by the report and he accidentally drops his lightsaber. The weapon skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. Jango flies higher and out of the picture. INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, TIPOCA CITY, LANDING PLATFORMBoba scrambles into the cockpit and scans the console panel. A wicked grin lights his face. BOBA FETT: Block this…EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAYObi-Wan recovers and looks around for Jango (who seems to have disappeared). He is tense in the silence. OBI-WAN: You have a lot to answer! It’ll go easier on you and your son if -- Obi-Wan senses something and turns just in time to see Slave I opening fire on him with its’ heavy blasters. The shots miss, but Obi-Wan is again knocked to the ground hard.Jango appears from above and jumps down. Obi-Wan recovers, and with a yell, leaps forward to jump-kick Jango in the face. Jango crashes back onto the landing platform. Obi-Wan lands on his feet. Jango quickly recovers and charges forward. INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, TIPOCA CITY, LANDING PLATFORMBoba Fett watches in horror as the two men crash into each other.EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAYIn close quarters, Obi-Wan blocks Jango's attempt to raise his blaster to fire as the pair struggle for the weapon. Obi-Wan then elbows Jango hard in the face. HIGH ANGLE shot as Obi-Wan then judo flips Jango over his back. Jango hits the ground hard but recovers quickly as Obi-Wan moves in for an attack. Jango grabs and traps Obi-Wan’s foot. Jango spins Obi-Wan (in mid air) and brings him down face-first onto the ground. Obi-Wan retaliates from the ground with a sweep kick to Jango's head, knocking him back. Obi-Wan gets to his feet. Jango also gets up and takes aim with his arm-mounted blaster. Obi-Wan leaps over the bolts and onto Jango's shoulders, then flips himself back and over, flipping Jango over and onto his back. But Jango then rolls to his feet. Obi-Wan charges with a punch. Jango moves in to attack, chopping at Obi-Wan's head. Obi-Wan blocks it. Jango ducks a wild punch and grabs Obi-Wan by his waist. He then savagely headbutts Obi-Wan to the ground. He lands and skids over the wet surface. Obi-Wan then comes to a halt on the ground and spots something… his lightsaber. Jango suddenly appears, flying towards Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan gets up and reaches for his lightsaber (to summon it with the Force). Jango fires a cable from his wrist that wraps around Obi-Wan's hands as he fails to catch his lightsaber. Jango takes off into the air (with jetpack again), still tied to Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan is dragged along the ground. LOW ANGLE behind Obi-Wan as he is being dragged. HIGH ANGLE on Jango, who is still flying. Obi-Wan then rolls to one side while being dragged. He manages to roll around, to the other side of one of the oncoming pillars. Obi-Wan then jumps up and wraps the cable around the pillar, pulling with all his weight against the momentum of the wire. Jango crashes to the ground. The jetpack shoots off on its own and into the side of a building, exploding. INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, TIPOCA CITY, LANDING PLATFORMBOBA FETT: DAD!!!EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAYJango scrambles across the wet floor to grab his fallen blaster. Obi-Wan (with his hands still tied) charges. Jango gets to his feet and fires, but misses. Obi-Wan kicks Jango over the side of the platform. Jango begins to slide down the angled side of the platform. Obi-Wan’s eyes go wide as he realizes what he’s done. OBI-WAN: Oh, not good --Obi-Wan, who is still connected to Jango by the cable, gets pulled to the edge of the platform. Almost over the complete edge, Jango activates the claws on the side of his forearm. Jango then digs his "claws" into the platform. Obi-Wan continues down, past Jango and falls over the edge. Still tied to Jango, Obi-Wan hangs, nothing between him and the raging sea. Obi-Wan then begins to swing back and forth. Jango is gradually getting pulled more and more down, so he releases the cable. DISTANT SHOT as Obi-Wan free-falls. Obi-Wan uses the Force and causes the wire to wrap around a pole, stopping his descent. When Jango looks down, the Jedi has disappeared. Jango uses his forearm claws to climb back to the landing platform and runs toward his ship. Obi-Wan swings and drops onto a small service platform just over the waves. Waving a door open with the Force, he disappears back into the city. INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, TIPOCA CITY, LANDING PLATFORMBoba Fett settles into the pilot’s seat and punches buttons. The engines ROAR. EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAYObi-Wan comes running out onto the landing platform and spots his lightsaber laying on the ground. This time, he retrieves it successfully with the Force and turns it on just as Jango’s ship engines roar. Realizing the ship is about to take off, Obi-Wan takes a small tracking device from his belt and throws it. The tracking device sticks to the hull of the ship. Obi-Wan watches from the platform as Slave I takes off into the rain. It disappears into the lowering sky, as lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams the surface of the platform where Obi-Wan stands, watching. EXT. SPACE – NEAR KAMINOSlave I screams into hyperspace. INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACEJango, now helmetless and in the pilot’s seat, lets out a relieved sigh. BOBA FETT: You smashed him up good! He never had a chance against you, Dad!JANGO FETT: To tell the truth, he had me in real trouble there. BOBA FETT: I got him good with the laser cannon! JANGO FETT: You did great. You’re learning well, Boba. Better than I ever believed possible. BOBA FETT: That’s because I’m a little you. Jango shakes his head. JANGO FETT: You’re better than I was at your age, and by a long way. If you keep working hard, you’ll be the best bounty hunter this galaxy’s ever seen. BOBA FETT: Which was your plan from the beginning, right? That’s why you wanted me? JANGO FETT: (wistful) That, and a few other reasons. He tousles the boy’s hair lovingly. JANGO FETT: And in every regard…in every hope and dream…you’ve done better than I expected. Boba hugs his dad tightly. For him, all is right with the universe.  WIPE TO: EXT. SPACEA small, chrome Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHOP - DAYThe Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. Anakin and Padme ride a rickshaw through the streets as Artoo rolls behind them. Anakin stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. PADME: (V.O.) Do you think he was involved? ANAKIN: (V.O.) Watto? If he’s hurt my mother in any way, I will pluck the wings from his back. Finally they come to Watto’s shop, and the rickshaw stops. Anakin gets down, and helps Padme down.ANAKIN: (to the droid driver) Wait right there.RICKSHAW DROID: Oki oki. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He has visibly aged, is bearded, and wears a sun hat on his head. Flies buzz all around him. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.WATTO: No chuba da wanga, da wanga! <No, not that one, that one!>ANAKIN: Chut chut, Watto. <Excuse me, Watto.>Watto turns to the chattering pit droids.WATTO: Go ana bopa. <Shut down.>The pit droids snap into their storage position. ANAKIN: Ding mi chasa hopa. <Let me help you with that…>Anakin takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. Watto blinks in surprise.WATTO: Ki booda? Yo baana pee hota? <What? What do you want?> As Anakin works on the equipment, his robe momentarily parts and reveals his lightsaber. Watto jumps. WATTO: Chada Jedi!! <Wait! You’re a Jedi!> He panics. WATTO: No bata tu tu!! <Whatever it is, I didn't do it!!>Watto drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese.ANAKIN: Mi boska di Shmi Skywalker. <I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.>Watto looks at him suspiciously. He stares at Padme, then back to Anakin. His eyes go wide…WATTO: (in English) Ani?!? Little Ani?!? Naaaah!!Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. Watto blinks at it.WATTO: You are Ani! It is you! (laughs) You little womp rat...Watto flies up (with some effort) and gives Anakin a big hug.WATTO: You sure sprouted, huh? Weehoo! A Jedi! Whaddya know? Hey, maybe you could help wit some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money...ANAKIN: My mother...WATTO: Oh, yeah. Shmi... ah, she's not mine no more. I…I sold her.Anakin goes ashen. ANAKIN: You sold her?!?WATTO: Years ago. Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business, huh? (chuckles) Sold her to a moisture farmer named, um, Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her -- and married her!! Can ya beat that, eh? (laughs again)ANAKIN: Do you know where they are now?WATTO: Ohhh, long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think...ANAKIN: I'd like to know.Anakin’s grim look means business; Watto gets the hint quickly.WATTO: Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's go look in my records, huh?Anakin, Watto and Padme go into the shop.EXT. SPACE, GEONOSISThe red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that forms rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it. Obi-Wan’s Starfighter, attached to the hyperspace transport ring, appears in space far behind Fett’s ship. The Starfighter disengages from the ring and follows Jango Fett’s ship. INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSISJango grins at Boba.JANGO FETT: Nearly there, son.Inside the cockpit, a small blip shows up on the ship’s scan screen. BOBA FETT: Dad, I think we’re being tracked…look at the scan screen! Isn’t that a cloaking shadow? Boba Fett checks the scan screen and reveals a small tracking device on the outer hull. JANGO FETT: He must have put a homing device on our hull during the fight. We’ll fix that. Hang on son – we’ll move into the asteroid field. He won’t be able to follow us there. And if he does, we’ll have a couple of surprises for him. Boba laughs maliciously. Jango punches some buttons, and the spot where the device was disappears. EXT. SPACE – GEONOSISJango Fett guides his ship into the asteroid fields. Slave I releases a charge which drifts toward Obi-Wan’s Starfighter. As the charge approaches, Arfour beeps in panic. INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSISOBI-WAN: WHOA!! Seismic charges – stand by!!EXT. SPACE – GEONOSIS RINGSObi-Wan’s ship banks sharply as the charge hits an asteroid. A blinding flash of light and momentary silence – then a huge BLLLANNNGGG as the asteroid shatters and a shockwave ripples across the asteroid field!! The shockwave fragments asteroids everywhere, and Obi-Wan desperately evades them. Slave I releases another charge. BLLAAANNGGG!! A huge asteroid is smashed apart, and the starfighter again spins and weaves through a speeding obstacle course of rock.  INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGSObi-Wan’s fighter reappears on Jango’s scopes. JANGO FETT: He doesn’t seem to take a hint, this guy. EXT. SPACE – GEONOSIS RINGSJango flies down a narrow tunnel in one of the larger asteroids. Obi-Wan plunges into the tunnel after him. He bobs and weaves his ship through the crags and rock formations.INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGSBOBA FETT: Watch out!!EXT. SPACE – GEONOSIS RINGSSlave I rolls in a complete spin and exits the asteroid tunnel. It flies up above, out of view, and flips over the asteroid. A second later, Obi-Wan’s ship shoots out, below and ahead of it.  INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGSBOBA FETT: Get him, Dad!! Get him! Fire!!EXT. SPACE – GEONOSIS RINGSJango Fett fires lasers at the Jedi Starfighter. The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, dodging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses.INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSISOBI-WAN: Oh blast -- This is why I hate flying!!It’s all he can do to avoid both the asteroids and Slave-I’s fire. EXT. SPACE – GEONOSIS RINGSBits of metal fly off Obi-Wan’s fighter as one of Jango’s missiles gets through. INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP – SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS Jango continues to bombard the Jedi Starfighter with laser fire. One bolt strikes Obi-Wan’s ship, causing a small explosion. BOBA FETT: You got him!JANGO FETT: We’ll just have to finish him. EXT. SPACE – GEONOSIS RINGSJango pushes buttons to open an outer hull door and releases a guided aerial torpedo. The torpedo closely follows Obi-Wan’s Starfighter.  INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGSIn Obi-Wan’s cockpit, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoid great rocks and the torpedo. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seems no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN: Arfour, prepare to jettison the spare parts containers!!The missile closes in. OBI-WAN: Release them NOW!!INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP – SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGSJango and Boba’s view of the Jedi fighter is obscured by a giant fireball. By the time it fades, Obi-Wan’s ship is nowhere in sight. Jango smiles. BOBA FETT: GOT HIM!! YEEAAHHHHH!!JANGO FETT: We won't see him again.Boba Fett laughs. EXT. SPACE – GEONOSIS RINGSJango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid belt. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted backside of the great rock.EXT. GEONOSIS – NIGHTSlave I swoops over a rocky expanse. Several spherical Trade Federation core ships are sitting on the surface around the vessel. Slave I turns and flips into landing position and lowers through an open hatch set into the ground, out of view. The hatch shuts, hiding the now-underground ship. INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER - SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGSObi-Wan’s ship is sitting on an asteroid. OBI-WAN: Well, Arfour, I think we’ve waited long enough. Follow his last known trajectory. EXT. SPACE – GEONOSIS RINGSObi-Wan’s fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis. INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER - GEONOSIS Obi-Wan looks out toward the surface of Geonosis and sees in the distance the large fleet of Trade Federation Core Ships.OBI-WAN: There’s an unusual concentration of Federation ships over there, Arfour. We’d better stay clear. EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA – NIGHTObi-Wan’s ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around. Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains. The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. Obi-Wan checks his bearings, then heads away. EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAYThe Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. Anakin and Padme get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where a homestead is seen on the desert floor below.PADME: Stay with the ship, Artoo.Artoo WHISTLES as Anakin and Padme start down the trail toward the homestead.EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM – LATE DAYUpon arriving at the Lars’ moisture farm, Anakin and Padme discover SEE-THREEPIO working outside. The droid now has a beat-up rusty tin skin. The droid trundles up to them. THREEPIO: Oh! Oh, hello. How might I be of service? I am See – ANAKIN: (shocked) – Threepio? Threepio abruptly recognizes the young man before him. THREEPIO: Oh my!! The maker!! Oh, Master Ani!! I knew you would return, I knew it!! And Miss Padme…PADME: Hello, Threepio. THREEPIO: Oh, my circuits! I’m so pleased to see you both! ANAKIN: I’ve come to see my mother? Threepio hesitates. THREEPIO: (whisper) Oh dear. I’m so terribly sorry, Master Anakin…Anakin begins to hyperventilate. PADME: (voice tinged with dread) Threepio, what’s happened? THREEPIO: Oh…um…I think…perhaps we’d better go indoors…Threepio leads them down into the courtyard.EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD – LATE DAYAnakin, Padme and Threepio arrive in the courtyard. Threepio shuffles ahead.THREEPIO: Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors? OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard. Both in their early twenties, plain-looking. ANAKIN: I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.Owen’s eyes go wide. OWEN: Anakin…!!BERU: Anakin the Jedi…ANAKIN: You know me? Shmi Skywalker is my mother…OWEN: Mine too. Not my real mom, but…as real a mom as I’ve ever known. Owen Lars.The two shake hands. OWEN: This is my girlfriend, Beru Whitesun.BERU: Hello.PADME: I'm Padme.OWEN: I guess I’m your stepbrother. I had a feeling you might show up some day.ANAKIN: Is my mother here?CLIEGG: No, she's not.CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.CLIEGG: Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... Anakin takes the offered hand. CLIEGG: We should go inside. We have a lot to talk about.INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAYBeru puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen.CLIEGG: (O.S.) It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAYCliegg, Owen, Padme and Anakin sit around the table, Beru brings the drinks from the kitchen.CLIEGG: Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators. From the tracks, she was about halfway home when they took her. (sigh) Those Tuskens walk like men… but they're vicious, mindless monsters. OWEN: (bitter) We’d seen signs they were about. She shouldn’t have gone out!CLIEGG: We can’t live huddled in fear. (to Anakin) All signs were that we’d chased the Tuskens away. We didn’t know how strong this raiding party was – stronger than anything any of us have ever seen. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I'd be out there with them, only... after I lost my leg, I just couldn't ride any more... until I heal.Cliegg grimaces, easing his throbbing leg. But it’s clear his torment isn’t just physical. He finally draws in a deep breath and squares his shoulders. CLIEGG: This isn't the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn't how your mother and I planned it. I don't want to give up on her, but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long.The words hit Anakin like a slap to the face, and he bolts to his feet.OWEN: Where are you going?ANAKIN: (cold and accusing) To find my mother.PADME: No, Ani!CLIEGG: Your mother’s dead, son. Accept it.Anakin stares daggers at them all, gritting his teeth. ANAKIN: I can feel her pain, and I will find her. OWEN: Take my speeder bike.ANAKIN: I know she's alive.Anakin turns abruptly and runs up the side of the homestead. Padme winces helplessly, and watches him go.OWEN: I wish he’d have come a bit earlier…EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAYAnakin stands looking across the desert. Padme comes running out of the homestead after him. Anakin turns to Padme.ANAKIN: You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe.PADME: Anakin...Padme hugs him tightly. ANAKIN: I know she’s alive. PADME: Find her. Anakin walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by. ANAKIN: I won't be long.Anakin swings onto the bike. The engine fires. He takes off across the desert. EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE – SUNSETTHREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. Anakin rides the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. The haunting choral wail and trumpets of “Duel of the Fates” blasts over the scene. EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP -- TWILIGHTAnakin stands in the middle of a crowd of Jawas asking them for directions. The Jawas confer excitedly, then the Chief Jawa points in a particular direction. Anakin gets on his swoop and speeds off to where the Jawa pointed.EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) -- NIGHTAnakin rides over a large dune, lit by the full moon overhead. He heads toward a small flickering light in the distance. He pulls up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of three dead farmers lying beside the campfire, all battered and torn. Two eopies are tethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder. ANAKIN: Calm down…find her…He closes his eyes and concentrates…then almost screams in agony.ANAKIN: mom…He leaps back onto the speeder bike, racing away faster and more desperate than ever. EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) -- NIGHTBack at the homestead, the lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal howls. EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) -- NIGHTPadme is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal howling nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE (FULL MOON) – NIGHTPadme enters the garage where Threepio sits working. THREEPIO: Hello, Miss Padme. PADME: Hello, Threepio. THREEPIO: You can’t sleep? PADME: No. I have too many things on my mind, I guess. THREEPIO: Are you worried about your work in the Senate? PADME: No. I’m just concerned about Anakin. I said things…I’m afraid I may have hurt him. I don’t know. Maybe I only hurt myself. For the first time in my life, I’m confused. THREEPIO: I’m not sure it will make you feel any better, Miss Padme, but I don’t think there’s been a time in my life when I haven’t been confused. PADME: I want him to know I care about him. (self-realization) I do care about him... THREEPIO: Don’t worry about Master Ani. He can take care of himself. Even in this awful place. EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHTObi-Wan climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a cry is heard close by. Obi-Wan stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of pebbles skittering into the distance. Obi-Wan listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it. He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and Obi-Wan ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. Obi-Wan stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up. A second Massiff jumps him from behind. Obi-Wan swings around and cuts it in half. The Massiff flies over the cliff. Howling, it plummets to its death hundreds of feet below. EXT. GEONOSIS, ANOTHER ROCK FACE TRAIL -- NIGHTObi-Wan arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stops, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.Obi-Wan takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Core Starships come into view. Obi-Wan touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Core Starships are in neat rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships down to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. Obi-Wan swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.OBI-WAN: Unbelievable…  EXT. GEONOSIS – TOWER ENTRANCE -- DAWNLight grows on the clustering tower of fantastic stalagmites. Obi-Wan sneaks up to the main one. He climbs up the side of the tower to a small window-like opening. Obi-Wan looks around quickly, then sneaks inside. INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS -- MORNINGObi-Wan makes his way along a narrow, pillared corridor. He comes to what looks like a large open well or vent shaft. He looks down and sees…A MONSTROUS DROID FOUNDRY. There are machines everywhere, pounding out countless battle droids identical to the ones that attacked Naboo a decade before. Completed battle droids are moving along a conveyor belt. Geonosians (without wings, a worker class) drone away on the assembly lines to assemble the droids. INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE -- MORNINGObi-Wan arrives at a vast expanse in the stalagmite interior. Immense pillars, soaring Gaudi-Gothic arches, vaulted roofs. The huge space is deserted – completely silent. Obi-Wan starts to cross the square. Suddenly he hears voices, and darts behind a pillar. We see COUNT DOOKU for the first time. A man in his late seventies, with short white hair and a silver beard, Dooku is very fit and trim for his age and is dressed in elegant clothes. Alongside him is VICEROY NUTE GUNRAY of the Trade Federation, POGGLE THE LESSER (Archduke of Geonosis), PASSEL ARGENTE and WAT TAMBOR. Obi-Wan flattens himself against the pillar as they pass by. COUNT DOOKU: Now we must convince the Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty. Then nothing in the universe will be able to stop us. NUTE GUNRAY: What about the Senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet?? I’m not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk!! COUNT DOOKU: I am a man of my word, Viceroy. WAT TAMBOR: The foundry is running at maximum capacity. In less than a few months, with these new battle droids we’ve built for you, Viceroy, you’ll have the finest army in the galaxy. NUTE GUNRAY: Your early tests on the Super Battle Droid prototypes have gone well. But they are a little less precise than I expected…WAT TAMBOR: Their advanced features will make up for that.They move off out of earshot. Obi-Wan peers around the pillar to see them going through an archway on the far side of the courtyard. There is a flight of stairs beside it. Obi-Wan arrives at the stairs. He sneaks up them, to arrive at a narrow gothic archway. He looks down through it. INT. GEONOSIS, CONFERENCE ROOM – DAYPoggle the Lesser and his TWO AIDES are at one end of a large conference table. COUNT DOOKU: Now is the time, my friends. This is the moment when you have to decide between the Republic…or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Count Dooku is at the head of the table. Jango Fett stands behind his chair. In addition to the original group, there are also three opposition senators: PO NUDO, TESSEK and TOONBUCK TOORA, and Commerce Guild dignitary SHU MAI and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. COUNT DOOKU: As I explained to you earlier, I am quite convinced that ten thousand more star systems will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen. And let me remind you of our absolute commitment to capitalism…of the lower taxes, the reduced tariffs, and the eventual abolition of all trade barriers. Signing this treaty will bring you all profits beyond your wildest imagination. What we are promising is completely free trade. PASSEL ARGENTE, the Corporate Alliance Representative, stands up.PASSEL ARGENTE: I am authorized by the Corporate Alliance to sign your treaty. COUNT DOOKU: We are most grateful for your cooperation, Chairman. Shu Mai stands up next. SHU MAI: (subtitled) The Commerce Guilds do not wish – at this time – to become openly involved. What you are proposing could be construed as treason. But we shall support the cause in secret, and look forward to doing business with you. Everyone chuckles at that. Count Dooku smiles.COUNT DOOKU: That is all we ask. Wat Tambor, the metallic Techno Union representative, twists a knob on his chest and speaks next. WAT TAMBOR: The Techno Union army (electronic gibberish) is at your disposal, Count. San Hill stands up. SAN HILL: The Banking Clan will sign your treaty, and support you wholeheartedly. But only in a non-exclusive arrangement…COUNT DOOKU: Good, very good. (nods to Nute) Our friends in the Trade Federation have pledged their full support. And when their battle droids are combined with yours, we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy. The Jedi will be overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make. INT. GEONOSIS, STAIRS -- DAYObi-Wan has heard enough. He pulls back from the archway.  EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) -- NIGHTAnakin pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the dried-mud huts at the edge of the camp has two Tusken guards outside it. Anakin drops off the edge of the cliff to the camp below. EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) -- NIGHTAnakin creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the walls, overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to hide himself until he arrives at the hut with two guards. They are sitting a short distance from the door. Anakin wriggles around the back. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall. INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUT -- NIGHTThe lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. Anakin wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere. A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, Anakin sees SHMI, hanging crucified from a cross-like wooden frame in the middle of the hut. He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face and body are covered in blood. She has been savagely beaten, starved and whipped. Anakin cradles her tenderly. ANAKIN: (eyes tearing up) Mom… mom…??SHMI: a…ani…? Shmi’s eyes flutter and barely open, caked with dried blood. SHMI: Is it you…? Her eyes focus slowly. Anakin gives a little choking gasp.ANAKIN: (voice shaking) I’m here, Mom. You’re safe. Hang on, I’m going to get you out of here…SHMI: ani….ani…. She smiles, seemingly all right…but her face, what little of it isn’t bloodied, is gray. Anakin shivers in fear. SHMI: You look so handsome…. He kisses her hand as she caresses his cheek. SHMI: (growing weaker by the second) my son… my grown up son….i’m so proud of you, ani… so proud… ANAKIN: I missed you so much… SHMI: now i am complete…i….l-love…She’s struggling for air. Anakin’s about to panic. ANAKIN: Stay with me, Mom!! I’m going to make you well again. Everything’s… going to be fine….SHMI: i…i love…Her breath stops in mid-sentence, and her eyes unfocus. She lolls against Anakin’s side, lifeless. Anakin is completely shattered, eyes pouring with tears. He looks down at her, and gently closes her eyes. There is silence for a moment. Anakin slowly looks up…and his expression is one of pure rage.  EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS – DAWNThe pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere a dog barks. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground. As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The child runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the two Tusken guards. Between them, Anakin stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The child stares, then there is a flash of light as Anakin’s lightsaber switches on. Before the guards can even turn, Anakin ignites his lightsaber and decapitates them both in one swing. The old Tusken woman sees this and runs screaming for help. Another Tusken Raider rushes at Anakin. With his teeth gritted, and wielding his lightsaber like a baseball bat, the Jedi apprentice chops the Tusken’s head from his body and sends it flying several feet. Anakin slowly, deliberately walks toward the little Tusken child, lightsaber raised, the same evil look on his face. He swings the sword down at the little girl – EXT. CORUSCANT, YODA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Yoda sits down Indian-style in a dimly lit, small, circular chamber. His eyes are closed as he attempts a meditative state. He sees nothing. But he hears something. It is a familiar voice, the surprisingly familiar voice of Qui-Gon Jinn. It is heard as though from a great distance, and it is filled with alarm.QUI-GON: (V.O.) Anakin!! ANAKIN!! NNNNOOOOOO!!!!!!!! Mace Windu enters the room and sits down. Yoda opens his eyes slowly and stares sadly at Mace. MACE WINDU: What is it? YODA: Pain…suffering…death, I feel…something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain…EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS – DAWNWith a feral snarl, Anakin buries his lightsaber up to the hilt in the old woman’s chest. With a weak scream, the woman crashes to the ground. Tuskens are now streaming out of every hut. Anakin leaps high into the air, bringing his weapon slashing down upon two of the Tuskens. With each death, his frenzy and bloodlust grows. Another Tusken rushes at him, wielding a spear. Anakin thrusts out a hand, and the Tusken is hurtled back through the Force thirty meters, smashing through a hut wall. Anakin continues swinging and slashing at the Tuskens. Arms, legs, heads, pieces of torso, all fall on the sandy ground. Blood is flying everywhere. Panic grips the surviving Tuskens, and they turn to flee. Several run into one of the huts. Anakin motions to a large boulder in the distance. The giant rock flies into the air, arcing, and smashes the hut flat. He begins running with unearthly speed after the remaining, fleeing Tuskens. A sickening, evil grin splits his face as he runs. EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA – DAYObi-Wan examines the transmitter dish on the Starfighter’s hull, and speaks with Arfour.OBI-WAN: The transmitter is working. But we’re not receiving a return signal – Coruscant’s too far. Arfour, can you boost the power? Arfour beeps doubtfully. OBI-WAN: Okay then, we’ll have to try something else. Obi-Wan jumps into the cockpit. OBI-WAN: Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo. It’s much closer. (works some controls) Anakin? Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin? (beat) He’s not on Naboo, Arfour. Arfour moans. Obi-Wan works on the console. OBI-WAN: I’m going to try and widen the range. I do hope nothing’s happened to him. The console beeps after a moment. Far off in the distance, a Geonosian spies Obi-Wan and his Starfighter from an overlooking cliff.OBI-WAN: That’s Anakin’s tracking signal all right, but it’s coming from… Tatooine. Obi-Wan hops back out of the starfighter. OBI-WAN: What in the blazes is he doing there?!? I told him to stay on Naboo!Arfour moans again.OBI-WAN: All right, we’re all set – we’ll get these answers later. We haven’t got much time. Transmit. (beat) Anakin? Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi…INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP -- DAYIn the ship, Artoo beeps as he fine-tunes the Starship’s receiver and captures the message. OBI-WAN: (V.O.) Record this message and take it to your mistress, Padme…and the Jedi Skywalker. (beat) Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant…INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - MORNINGPadme keeps a lonely vigil with Owen, Beru, Threepio and Cliegg. Owen looks over at Threepio, then over at Padme. OWEN: Padme…I’m returning this droid to Anakin. I know that’s what my mom would want. Padme nods. A growing noise from outside, the whine of the speeder bike, brings the whole group rushing outdoors. EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM – MORNINGPadme and the Lars family rush outside – and stop, shocked. Anakin climbs down from the speeder bike, unties his mother’s dead body from the bike, then trudges toward them bearing the body in his arms. With glassy eyes, he walks up to a trembling Cliegg and stares at him silently. It’s all Beru can do to keep from openly sobbing. Owen drapes his arm around Beru’s shoulders, a tear streaking down his cheek. Padme moves over to Anakin to try to console him with a hug. He pushes her away. He won’t look at her. He won’t look at any of them. ANAKIN: If I hadn't gone away, none of this would have happened. We'd be happy.CLIEGG: You'd still be slaves.ANAKIN: But at least she'd still be alive.He slowly carries his mother’s body into the homestead. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – KITCHEN -- MORNINGPadme prepares some food for Anakin, and Beru helps her. BERU: What’s it like there? PADME: I’m sorry? BERU: On Naboo. What’s it like? Padme is completely preoccupied with her concern for Anakin, but does her best to reply. PADME: Oh, it’s…very green. With lots of water and trees. Not like here at all. She takes out a tray and starts to put the food on it. BERU: I think I like it here better. PADME: Maybe you’ll come and see it one day. BERU: I don’t think so. I don’t like to travel. They finish preparing the tray, and Padme smiles at Beru. PADME: Thanks, Beru. She goes out. INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE – DAYAnakin stands at a workbench, working slowly on a part off the speeder bike. Padme quietly comes in with a tray of food. She puts the tray down and stares sadly at Anakin. He’s staring at the welder in his hand, doing nothing. PADME: I brought you something. Are you hungry? A long beat. Padme puts the tray down. ANAKIN: The shifter broke. (long beat) Life seems so much simpler when you’re fixing things. I’m good at fixing things, always was. But I couldn’t…He looks over at Padme. ANAKIN: Why did she have to die? Why couldn’t I save her…?? I know I could have…Anakin turns and stalks away from the bench. PADME: Sometimes there are things no one can fix. You’re not all-powerful, Ani…ANAKIN: Well, I should be! Someday I will be…I will be the most powerful Jedi ever! I promise you, I will even learn to stop people from dying!! PADME: Anakin—ANAKIN: It’s all OBI-WAN’S fault!! He put me out of the way! PADME: To guard me. ANAKIN: I should have been out there with him, hunting the assassins!! I’d have had them a long time ago, and would have gotten back here in time, and my mother would still be alive!! PADME: You can’t know that!!ANAKIN: He’s jealous!! He knows I’m already more powerful than he is!!! HE’S HOLDING ME BACK!!!!!!Anakin violently hurls the welder across the garage, and Padme jumps. The welder clatters to the floor. Anakin looks down at his shaking hands. Padme stares at him, shocked.PADME: What’s wrong, Ani…??ANAKIN: I JUST TOLD YOU!!!PADME: NO!! No. What’s really wrong??He doesn’t answer for a long moment. PADME: I know it hurts. But this is more than that. What’s really wrong? He just stares at her. PADME: ani…?His shoulders slump.  ANAKIN: I….I killed them. I killed them all…they’re dead, every single one of them.PADME: You did battle… Anakin focuses on her, like someone returning from far away. ANAKIN: And not just the men…the women and children too…His face is alight with guilt…but also with satisfaction. Pride, even. Padme is stunned, staring at Anakin in a terrified new light.  ANAKIN: (shaking with rage) They’re like animals…and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM!!! There is silence for a moment. Then Anakin breaks down, sagging against a console, sobbing uncontrollably. Padme gently takes him into her arms.  ANAKIN: Why do I hate them?!? PADME: They earned your anger, Anakin. ANAKIN: I didn’t…I couldn’t…I couldn’t control myself…I don’t want to hate them…but I just can’t forgive them…PADME: To be angry is to be human. ANAKIN: To control your anger is to be a Jedi. PADME: Shhh… you’re human. ANAKIN: No, I’m a Jedi – I know I’m better than this…. I’m sorry…i’m so sorry…PADME: You’re like everyone else…She rocks the sobbing Anakin in her arms, tears streaming down her face as well. WIPE TO:EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GRAVESITE – DAYAnakin, Padme, Threepio and the Lars family are gathered outside, somber, around Shmi’s freshly filled grave. Two other ebony headstones, one smaller than the other, stand in the blazing sun. CLIEGG: I know wherever you are, it’s become a better place. You were the most loving partner a man could ever have. Goodbye, my darling wife…and thank you. A pause. Then Anakin kneels before the black gravestone. He picks up a handful of sand and lets it slip through his fingers.  ANAKIN: I’m sorry. He almost breaks down again, but takes a deep breath and continues. ANAKIN: I wasn’t strong enough to save you, Mom. I wasn’t strong enough. But I promise…I won’t fail again… Forcing down another sob, he stands up. ANAKIN: I miss you so m-much…Padme comes forward and puts her hand on Anakin’s shoulder. Silence. Then a flurry of whistles and beeps as Artoo comes up toward them. PADME: Artoo, what are you doing here? Why have you left the ship??Another flurry of whistles from Artoo. THREEPIO: It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you? INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP -- DAYAnakin, Padme and Artoo return to the Naboo starship and replay the holo message from Obi-Wan. They watch the flickering image. OBI-WAN: (V.O.) Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant. Padme turns and reaches over to a control board. She punches a button to transmit the message. OBI-WAN: (V.O.) I have tracked the bounty hunter Jango Fett to the droid foundries on Geonosis.INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE -- NIGHTIn a flickering hologram, Obi-Wan’s message is replayed before an alarmed group consisting of Yoda, Mace Windu, Ki-Adi Mundi, Luminara Unduli, Barriss Offee, STASS ALLIE, and Senators Bail Organa, Jar Jar, Ask Aak and ONACONDA FARR from Rodia.OBI-WAN: (V.O.) The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here…and it is clear that Viceroy Nute Gunray…INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP -- DAYOBI-WAN: (V.O.) …is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala. Anakin and Padme are grim and silent. Neither are surprised to hear this. INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE -- NIGHTThe Jedi and Senators continue to listen to Obi-Wan. OBI-WAN: (V.O.) The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming a --Suddenly, on the holoimage, DROIDEKAS appear on every side of Obi-Wan. He speed-draws his lightsaber -- OBI-WAN: WAIT!! WAIT – INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP – DAYAnakin and Padme bolt upright as the image of Obi-Wan is moved out of view and replaced by the firing droidekas. The image suddenly cuts out. ANAKIN: MASTER!! I’m going after him!INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE -- NIGHTThe Senators are immobilized with wide-eyed horror. Palpatine stares at the blank holoprojector in ashen disbelief. Yoda looks over to Mace Windu. YODA: He is still alive. I feel him in the Force. MACE WINDU: But they have taken him. And the wheels have begun to spin more dangerously.YODA: More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed. MACE WINDU: I agree. We must not sit idly by.Yoda closes his eyes, pained by it all. YODA: The Dark Side I feel…all is cloudy…  Mace nods and looks at the now-empty hologram.MACE WINDU: Anakin -- INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP -- DAYA holoimage of Mace Windu appears where Obi-Wan’s was. MACE WINDU: (V.O.) We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your first priority.ANAKIN: Understood, Master. The hologram fades away. Padme is horrified at the look of utter resignation and defeat on Anakin’s face. She looks at the readout on the ship's control panel.PADME: They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look… Padme starts to hit buttons and flick switches. A star map comes up on the console. PADME: Geonosis is less than a parsec away.ANAKIN: If he's still alive.He gets up and starts to walk off. Padme is incensed.PADME: Ani, are you just going to sit here and let him die?!? He's your friend, your mentor --ANAKIN: He's like my father!! (on her look) Well, you heard Master Windu -- he gave me strict orders to stay here!!PADME: He gave you strict orders to protect me...and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.She pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines warm up. PADME: So if you plan to protect me, you will just have to come along.Anakin stares at her…and slowly grins. He sits down and takes the controls. Threepio comes forward from the back of the starship and straps himself into a seat behind Padme. Artoo whistles at him. THREEPIO: I’m not worried, Artoo. It’s just…I’ve never flown before… EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD – DAYThe Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.   INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE -- DAYBail Organa paces around. The others are all silent. BAIL ORGANA: The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that. ASK AAK: If the report is accurate. MACE WINDU: It is, Senator. PALPATINE: Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them…BAIL ORGANA: We must stop them. Now, before they’re fully ready. JAR JAR: Exsqueeze me, yousa honorable Supreme Chancellor, sir. Maybe dissen Jedi stoppin’ da rebel army? PALPATINE: Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis? Yoda and Mace look at each other with a mutual sinking feeling. YODA: Throughout the galaxy, thousands of Jedi there are. To send on a special mission…only two hundred are available.Everyone in the room is stunned. BAIL ORGANA: Two hundred?!? With all due respect for the Jedi Order, that doesn’t sound like enough!! YODA: Through negotiation the Jedi maintain peace. To start a war, we do not intend. ASK AAK: (to Palpatine) The debate is over!! Now we need that clone army.BAIL ORGANA: Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never approve the use of clones before the separatists attack. By then, it would be too late. MAS AMEDDA: (panic) This is a crisis!! The Senate must vote the Chancellor emergency powers!! He can then approve the creation of an army!!PALPATINE: Please, please. I don’t wish to have emergency powers – it’s too extreme a solution. It’s akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi.ASK AAK: We must prepare for the worst. I’m going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait! PALPATINE: Out of the question, Senator!! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will quickly become partisan, then debates will begin…no. BAIL ORGANA: We have spent too much of our political capital. The Senate will not see our call as anything more than overly alarmist. PALPATINE: But what Senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment? BAIL ORGANA: We need a voice of reason. One willing to reverse position even, given the gravity of the current situation. MAS AMEDDA: (despair) If only… Senator Amidala were here…PALPATINE: Hmm. A beat. Then Jar Jar suddenly steps into the center of the room. JAR JAR: Mesa mosto Supreme Chancellor, mesa gusto palos…mesa proud to proposing da motion to give Yousa Honor emergency powers. ASK AAK: (overjoyed) Thank you, Representative Binks!A moment. Then Palpatine sighs deeply. PALPATINE: If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day of my life.  INT. GEONOSIS, PRISON CELL -- DAYObi-Wan is being suspended in mid-air by a blue electric beam in the center of a vast circular chamber. Count Dooku walks in, regarding the Jedi with a measure of pity and worry. OBI-WAN: Traitor.COUNT DOOKU: Oh no, my friend. This is a mistake. A terrible mistake. They’ve gone too far this time. This is madness…OBI-WAN: I thought you were the leader here, Dooku. COUNT DOOKU: This had nothing to do with me, I assure you. I promise you, I will petition immediately to have you set free. OBI-WAN: (cynically) Well, I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have work to do. Dooku is disturbed by Obi-Wan’s open hostility and changes tactics. COUNT DOOKU: May I ask why a Jedi Knight is all the way out here on Geonosis? OBI-WAN: I’ve been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Do you know him? COUNT DOOKU: There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of. Geonosians don’t trust them. OBI-WAN: Well, who can blame them? But he is here, I can assure you. COUNT DOOKU: It’s a great pity that our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you. (quiet) I wish he were still alive…I could use his help right now. Dooku is genuinely regretful, but Obi-Wan remains defiant. OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you!!COUNT DOOKU: Don’t be so sure, my young Jedi. You forget that he was once my apprentice, just as you were once his. He knew all about the corruption in the Senate. They all knew. But he would have never gone along with it if he had known the truth as I have. OBI-WAN: The truth?!?COUNT DOOKU: The truth. (beat) What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control of the Dark Lord of the Sith? Obi-Wan is floored by this revelation. OBI-WAN: NO!! That’s not possible!! The Jedi would be aware of it!!COUNT DOOKU: The Dark Side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend. Hundreds of Senators are now under the influence of a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious. Obi-Wan shakes his head. OBI-WAN: I don’t believe you…COUNT DOOKU: (passionate) The Viceroy of the Trade Federation was once in league with this Darth Sidious, but he was betrayed ten years ago by the Dark Lord. He came to me for help. He told me everything. The Jedi Council would not believe him. I have tried many times to warn them, but they wouldn’t listen to me. Once they sense the Dark Lord’s presence and realize their error, it will be too late. You must join me, Obi-Wan…and together we will destroy the Sith!! OBI-WAN: (cold) I will never join you, Dooku. Dooku sags, shaking his head. COUNT DOOKU: It may be difficult to secure your release. He turns and leaves the room. WIPE TO:INT. GALACTIC SENATE HALL, UPPER CORRIDOR -- EVENINGMace Windu walks down an upper corridor and meets Yoda, who is sitting on a ledge overlooking the Senate chamber. Inside the grand rotunda, the uproar is deafening. Senators on opposing sides yell wildly and furiously at each other. MAS AMEDDA: Order!! ORDER!!!Finally, the tumult dies down. PALPATINE: In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognizes the Senior Representative of Naboo… Jar Jar Binks.Amid a conflicting storm of cheers and boos, Jar Jar, with Captain Typho, floats his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at Palpatine nervously. Palpatine nods. Jar Jar clears his throat. JAR JAR: Itsa clear desa Separtists made a pact witha desa Federation traitors. Senators, dellow felogates... The Senate explodes with moans, laughter and jeers. Jar Jar blushes.MAS AMEDDA: ORDER!! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a hearing.The rotunda goes comparatively quiet. Jar Jar grips the edge of his podium, trying to speak as clearly as possible.INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER -- EVENINGJar Jar stands in his pod as it floats in the middle of the vast space. JAR JAR: In response to dis direct threat to da Republic from da Confederacy of Independent Systems…mesa propose dat da Senate gib immediately emergency powers to da Supreme Chancellor. Uproar again fills the senate. JAR JAR: Whosa can deny dese are excepteenal times?!? Excepteenal times demand excepteenal measures! Excepteenal measures demand excepteenal men!!!The pod for Ryloth swings into the center of the chamber.ORN FREE TAA: We won’t support a dictator!Several cheers rise from the Senate. JAR JAR: Dat isa sentiment ebry one of us agrees wid! And whensa da shadow of war hasen dispersed and da bright day of liberty hasen dawned again, da powers wesa now given to da Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned.The Senate goes quiet. JAR JAR: Oursa ancient liberties will be restored to usen, burnished eben more brightly dan before! There is a rolling wave of applause. Jar Jar beams and bows. MAS AMEDDA: Order! We shall have order!The applause dies down. Palpatine rises.PALPATINE: It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy… I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to rule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to see the destruction of democracy. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated, I promise you. And as my first act with this new authority, I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists. The Senate explodes with cheers. MAS AMEDDA: We shall proceed to the vote. All those in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal aye at this time… those opposed?The vote is overwhelming positive, with almost no dissenting votes. INT. GALACTIC SENATE HALL, UPPER CORRIDOR -- EVENINGYoda shakes his head sadly. Mace Windu is equally grave. MACE WINDU: It is done then. (beat, then to Yoda) I will take what Jedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan. YODA: Visit I will the cloners on Kamino, and see this army they have created for the Republic.EXT. SPACE The Naboo Starship comes out of hyperspace and zooms toward the ringed planet of Geonosis. EXT. GEONOSIS – DAYAnakin pilots the starship close to the ground, weaving around towering rock formations. INT. ROYAL CRUISER – COCKPIT (GEONOSIS)PADME: (pointing) See those columns of steam straight ahead? They’re exhaust vents of some type. ANAKIN: That’ll do. EXT. GEONOSIS – DAYAnakin pilots the craft straight down into a column, flying through the steam and landing at the bottom.INT. ROYAL CRUISER – COCKPIT (GEONOSIS)Anakin and Padme get up from their seats and head for the ship’s hatch. PADME: Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead. I’m not interested in getting into a war here. As a member of the Senate, maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess. ANAKIN: Don’t worry. I’ve give up trying to argue with you. Artoo gives a plaintive wail. THREEPIO: My obtuse little friend. If they had needed our help, they would have asked for it. You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behavior.  INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS – DAYAnakin and Padme cautiously proceed into the steam-filled stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness. INT. ROYAL CRUISER COCKPIT (GEONOSIS)Artoo watches them out the window as they vanish from sight, and moans with worry. THREEPIO: Danger? Oh no, I shouldn’t think so. It looks like a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo. Artoo turns and heads back for the ramp, beeping furiously. Threepio totters after him. THREEPIO: For a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking. I am programmed to understand humans. Artoo bursts out a few short and curt beeps. THREEPIO: “What does that mean?” That means I am in charge here! Artoo starts down the landing ramp. THREEPIO: Hey! Where are you going now?!? You don’t know what’s out there!! Have you no sense at all?!?Artoo blatts at him. THREEPIO: Oh, idiot!INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS, NABOO STARSHIP -- DAYThreepio watches from the hatch as Artoo rolls down the ramp. Artoo gains speed as he touches the rocky ground of Geonosis and rolls away. THREEPIO: Please wait! Do you know where you’re going?!? Threepio reluctantly starts down the ramp after the little droid. INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS – DAYAnakin and Padme continue on. High above them, at the top of the stalagmites, the rock formations seem to swell and pulse. Then several winged creatures detach themselves from the rocks and swoop down towards the couple…ANAKIN: Wait…Anakin spins around as one of the winged creatures attacks him. Lightsaber blazing, Anakin cuts down three creatures as Padme exits through a far doorway. INT. GEONOSIS, DROID FOUNDRY – DAYAnakin reaches Padme, and they both stand on the edge of a short walkway extending over a deep crevasse. The door behind them closes, stranding the two. The walkway retracts and Padme slips and then jumps down onto a conveyor belt leading into the droid factory.ANAKIN: PADME!!!Anakin jumps down and slashes more winged creatures while attempting to reach Padme. One of the creatures is crushed by a falling stamper. Padme makes her way across stamping machines and welders, timing her moves and dodging the machines as Anakin follows, beating back winged creatures. Back up above, Threepio and Artoo have appeared at the entranceway to the foundry.THREEPIO: Oh my goodness! Shut me down -- machines creating machines! How perverse!  Artoo whistles in fury and bumps Threepio. The taller droid teeters at the edge, but regains his footingTHREEPIO: Calm down, Artoo! I almost fell. You’ll get your chance -- Artoo bumps even harder and pushes Threepio off the small ledge and onto a flying Conveyor Droid. THREEPIO: I’M SCRAP!! IT’S A NIGHTMARE!!! I WANT TO GO HOME!!!Flailing and screaming, Threepio is plucked off the droid and thrown onto the conveyor belt. THREEPIO: (groan) What did I do to deserve this…??Back at the ledge, two rocket jets shoot out of Artoo’s sides and the little robot flies up and into the factory. Anakin continues to work his way towards Padme, lightsaber flashing, winged creatures attacking from all directions. Padme wrestles with one Creature, and is thrown into a large empty vat moving down the assembly line. Mechanized arms carry the vat to a position where molten metalwill be poured into it. Padme struggles to find handholds for escape, but is unsuccessful. Artoo sees this and flies towards Padme.See-Threepio, meanwhile, is walking down a walkway beside a conveyor belt. THREEPIO: Hmm. I wonder what’s happened to poor little Artoo. He’s always getting himself into trouble -- Suddenly a robot arm swings across and smashes Threepio’s head from his body!! THREEPIO’S HEAD: OH NO!!!His head lands in a line of Battle Droid heads. Threepio’s headless body walks blindly into another assembly line, sandwiched between Battle Droids. A Battle Droid head is welded onto Threepio’s body.  BATTLE DROID HEAD: Uh oh…Meanwhile, Threepio’s head is picked by a robot arm and moved into another assembly line where it is welded onto a Battle Droid’s body. THREEPIO’S HEAD: I’m so confused…Meanwhile, Anakin continues to battle creatures. He is knocked to the ground by a robot arm, and his right arm becomes locked and welded into a loading device. Anakin comes closer and closer to the cutting machine…As Padme continues her struggle to escape the vat, Artoo finds the computer port controlling the vat and programs Padme’s to dump her out onto a walkway. Anakin ignites his lightsaber in an attempt to free his arm. The cutter approaches -- he maneuvers his body away from the cutter, but it slams down and cuts his lightsaber in half. He regains his feet and swings at a robot arm – then realizes he’s only holding half of his weapon. ANAKIN: Not again!! Obi-Wan’s gonna kill me…Winged creatures and several droidekas surround Anakin and Padme on all sides. Jango Fett swoops down from the sky on his jetpack, blaster aimed at the both of them. JANGO FETT: Don’t move, Jedi!The group of winged creatures part to reveal Count Dooku. He bows to them in greeting. COUNT DOOKU: Senator Amidala. I’ve heard so much about you. PADME: Count Dooku, I presume. COUNT DOOKU: I’m delighted to finally meet you. We have so much to talk about. Come. He gestures for the two to follow him. COUNT DOOKU: I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control. PADME: Don’t worry, he’s housebroken. JANGO FETT: (to the droidekas) Take him away!Anakin glares at Padme as they follow the Count out of the clearing. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) – DAYAnakin and Padme are led into a large conference room. Count Dooku sits across from them, with Jango next to him. Ten Geonosian guards are spread throughout the room. PADME: You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me – now. COUNT DOOKU: He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe. Anakin and Padme are stunned. Dooku smiles. PADME: He is an officer of the Republic!! You can’t do that!!COUNT DOOKU: We don’t recognize the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency…Anakin grits his teeth. PADME: And if I don’t join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die? COUNT DOOKU: I don’t wish to make you join our cause against your will, Senator. But you are a rational, honest representative of your people…and I assume you want to do what’s in their best interest. Aren’t they fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all? Aren’t you? Be honest, Senator. Padme hesitates before replying. PADME: The ideals are still alive, Count. Even if the institution is failing. Dooku’s smile grows wider. COUNT DOOKU: You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent. PADME: If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right. COUNT DOOKU: I admit the Chancellor means well, M’Lady. But he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy. But here it is, ten years later, and the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? The Republic cannot be fixed, M’Lady. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, no? A shell game played on the voters. The time will come when the cult of greed called ‘the Republic’ will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom. Padme is shaken by the Count’s sincere words. PADME: I cannot believe that. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business…it’s business becoming government! I will not forsake all that I have honored and worked for and betray the Republic.COUNT DOOKU: Then you will betray your Jedi friends? Without your cooperation, I can do nothing to stop their execution. PADME: And in that statement lies the truth of your proposed ‘improvement.’ A flash of terrifying anger crosses Dooku’s face for a moment; then he is his calm and regal self again. PADME: What about me? Am I to be executed as well? COUNT DOOKU: (patronizing) I wouldn’t think of such an offense. But there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M’Lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I’m afraid. It’s purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I’m sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I’m sorry, but if you are not going to cooperate I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. Without your cooperation, I’ve done all I can for you. PADME: (scoffs) “Justice”…JANGO FETT: Take them away. Anakin and Padme are hauled out of the room by Geonosian guards. INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER – DAYAnakin and Senator Amidala are taken into the center of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them, in a tall boxed-off area, are many of the separatist leaders of their respective worlds. Count Dooku; Archduke Poggle the Lesser; Senators Po Nudo, Tessek and Toonbuck Toora; Commerce dignitaries Shu Mai, Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation, Passel Argente, Wat Tambor, and finally San Hill of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall, about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.SUN FAC: You have been charged and found guilty of espionage. POGGLE: (subtitled) Have you anything to say before your sentence is carried out? PADME: You’re committing an act of war, Archduke! I hope you’re prepared for the consequences! Poggle laughs, and Count Dooku smiles.  POGGLE: (subtitled) We build weapons of war – it is our business! Of course we are prepared!NUTE: (annoyed) Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer. POGGLE: (subtitled) Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator… take them to the arena!Four guards take hold of Anakin and Padme, and they are dragged out to the sound of the Confederacy’s laughter. INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAYIn a gloomy tunnel, Anakin and Padme are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other. The DRIVER gets up onto his seat. ANAKIN: Don’t be afraid. PADME: (whisper) I’m not afraid to die. I’ve been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life. A beat. ANAKIN: What are you talking about…? PADME: I love you. Anakin’s eyes go wide. ANAKIN: You love me?!? I thought that we had decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. And that it would destroy our lives… PADME: Look around. I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. (beat) My love for you is a puzzle, Ani, for which I have no answers. I can’t control it…and now I don’t care to. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know. Padme leans toward Anakin. Straining, it’s just barely possible for their lips to meet. ANAKIN: (breathless) I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.  They kiss again. The music swells...The driver cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward, breaking the kiss. Suddenly, there is a HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena.EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAYThe great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling Geonosians. The cart carrying Anakin and Padme stops in the middle of the arena near six tall columns. Padme quickly pulls a wire from her clothing and places it in her mouth. Obi-Wan stands with his hands bound overhead by chains to the fourth column. The Geonosian guard cuffs Padme to the second column and then escorts Anakin in chains to the third between Padme and Obi-Wan. Anakin looks over to his master. OBI-WAN: I was beginning to wonder if you’d got my message. ANAKIN: I retransmitted it, just as you requested, Master... Obi-Wan gives him a cold stare. ANAKIN:  ... then we decided to come and rescue you. The Geonosian guard lifts Anakin's hands above his head and into the restraints. OBI-WAN: (sarcasm) Good job. Anakin gives Obi-Wan an icy stare of his own, then looks straight ahead. A second Geonosian comes to Padme and begins adjusting her hand restraints as well. She is looking at Anakin. The cart is wheeled away. There is another roar as Poggle the Lesser, Count Dooku, Nute Gunray, the Fetts, and dignitaries arrive in the Archducal box and take their places. POGGLE: (subtitled) Settle down, settle down…The crowd quiets down.SUN FAC: The felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the Sovereign System of Geonosis. Their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth.The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. POGGLE: (subtitled) Let the executions begin.The crowd goes wild. From different gates around the arena, three monsters are driven in. They are the REEK (bull-like), the NEXU (lion-like) and the ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven by PICADORS carrying long electric spears and riding Orrays. The Nexu jumps and eats the Picador prodding it, only to be shocked by the poles of two others.ANAKIN: I’ve got a bad feeling about this…The Picadors poke the monsters toward the center of the arena, and then retire to the perimeter. The monsters toss their heads, looking around, roaring and screeching. Then they catch sight of the three captives and start moving towards them.  OBI-WAN: Just relax, concentrate. Take the one on the right. I’ll take the one on the left. ANAKIN: What about Padme? Padme has used the wire she concealed to pick the lock on one of her hand restraints. She spins around and pulls herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free. OBI-WAN: (drily) She seems to be on top of things. Obi-Wan ducks around the post as the Acklay charges at him. It knocks the post flat, sending Obi-Wan sprawling. The Acklay crunches the post between its’ claws, freeing Obi-Wan’s chain. Obi-Wan leaps up and runs at one of the Picadors. The Acklay takes off after him.The Reek charges at Anakin. He leaps up, and the beast hits the post hard. Anakin lands on its’ back, wrapping part of his chain around its’ horn. The Reek backs off, shaking its’ head angrily. The shaking tears the chain from the post. The Nexu arrives at Padme’s post and rears on its hind legs. Up top, Padme struggles to tear her chain free. The Nexu roars, displaying wicked dripping fangs. The Nexu’s claws dig deep into Padme’s post. Padme hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. With a single leap, the creature reaches the top and slashes at Padme. She turns and the claw catches her shirt, ripping off the lower half, and gouging huge bloody scratches into her back. She screams in agony.Up at the Archducal box, Nute Gunray is rubbing his hands in glee, laughing like a school boy.Obi-Wan is rolling on the ground for his life, barely one step ahead of the screeching Acklay and its’ claw that repeatedly sinks into the ground where he was a second ago.Anakin’s Reek starts to buck. It charges around the arena with Anakin hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of his chin around his head and casts it into the Reek’s mouth. Its’ jaws clamp hard on the chain. Anakin yanks back on the chain, turning the Reek, beginning to ride it. But the creature is too wild and rough, and Anakin is thrown from the creature’s back and dragged across the sandy ground by the chain.  Padme jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand. Padme climbs back up the pole, scrambling to the top. The crowd begins to boo. Up in the Archuducal box, Nute Gunray is outraged. NUTE: FOUL!! She can’t do that!! Shoot her or something!! Obi-Wan finds an Orray-riding Picador trying to spear him down. The Orray rears up. Obi-Wan grabs the Picador’s long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing Acklay smashes into the Orray, taking it down. The Picador tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the Acklay and crunched. The Reek finally comes to a stop, and Anakin regains his feet. He walks slowly towards the creature, hands out, trying to calm and tame it with the power of the Force. Finally he leaps back atop it and rides it again. The Nexu springs up and braces to leap up at Padme again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. Anakin comes charging up on the Reek and gores the Nexu, killing it. ANAKIN: You okay? Padme nods, gasping. PADME: Sure!ANAKIN: Jump!!!Padme leaps from the top of the post to land on the Reek behind Anakin. She kisses him on the cheek. The Reek charges away across the arena. Obi-Wan runs out from behind the fallen Orray and throws the spear at the Acklay, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible screech and bites down on the spear, yanking it out of its’ side and snapping it in two. The Reek passes Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan runs and jumps on the back of the Reek behind Anakin and Padme. In the Archducal box, Nute Gunray turns angrily to Count Dooku. NUTE GUNRAY: This isn’t how it’s supposed to be!! I want her DEAD!! Jango, finish her off!!Jango gets up, but a smiling Dooku gently puts him back down with one arm. He’s clearing enjoying the spectacle. COUNT DOOKU: (enigmatic smile) Patience, Viceroy, patience – she will die. EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY Droidekas roll to the center of the arena where they transform into battle configuration and surround the Reek, containing Padme and the Jedi. Behind Count Dooku and the three other dignitaries, in the entrance to the Archducal section, a flash of light appears and knocks out one of the Geonosian guards. This event goes unnoticed by the four spectators. A dark hand then taps Dooku’s shoulder. Dooku turns around as… Mace Windu reveals himself while holding Jango at bay with his purple-bladed lightsaber. Dooku masks his surprise elegantly. COUNT DOOKU: Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.MACE WINDU: Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party’s over. Mace signals. At strategic areas in the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI enter from all passageways, lightsabers ignited. The crowd is suddenly silent. Count Dooku’s lips curl in slight amusement.COUNT DOOKU: Brave but, uh… foolish, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered.MACE WINDU: I don't think so. The Geonosians aren’t warriors. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians.Dooku looks around the great theater, his smile growing.COUNT DOOKU: We’ll see.Dooku signals…. and THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena!! Mace turns as the army (battle droids, destroyer droids, and even super battle droids) emerge from the dark passageway behind them. CUT TO a HIGH ANGLE of the VIP box as droids are coming from all entrances in the remote area. Mace is surrounded. Jango backs out of firing range. The droids then unmercifully open fire. Mace deflects the first few bolts as Dooku and the other dignitaries attempt to move to safer ground. The droids continue to fire as Mace deflects the bolts right back at them. WIDE SHOT of Mace as he spins and deflects shots from all sides. A number of droids are smashed back by their own bolts. Jango then brings up his flamethrower and fires at Mace. Geonosians fly away in the background. Mace leaps as the flame scorches the area where he was, but his cloak catches on fire. Jango then blasts at Mace in the air. Mace deflects all the bolts as he flips in mid air and down into the arena, his cloak still on fire. Once on the ground of the arena, Mace throws off his burning cloak. From the Archducal box, Boba Fett watches the unfolding battle. WIDE SHOT as Jedi fight for their lives against the superior number of droids. Two Jedi leap from another box just as it’s blasted by droids. MORE SHOTS of Jedi defending themselves from attacks on all sides. One Jedi destroys a Super Droid but is suddenly gunned down by a Destroyer Droid. The airborne Geonosians fire ray guns down at the Jedi, and they prove much more difficult to deflect. Threepio’s body with the battle droid head enters the arena. BATTLE DROID HEAD: My legs aren’t moving. I must need maintenance.Several Jedi run to the center of the arena and throw lightsabers to Obi-Wan and Anakin. A blast rocks the Reek, and the three tumble off. Padme jumps on top of the Orray pulling the execution wagon. Anakin runs, jumps and lands in the cart, deflecting laser blasts with his lightsaber. Padme blasts battle droids as the two ride through the arena.The battle droid body with Threepio’s head enters the arena, carrying a blaster rifle and firing at the Jedi. THREEPIO: What’s all this noise?!? Oh – a battle!! There must be some terrible mistake! I’m programmed for etiquette, not destruction!!!Mace Windu runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with Obi-Wan, as they swipe and mangle droids.OBI-WAN: Someone's got to shut down these droids!!MACE WINDU: Don't worry! It's being taken care of!EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAYKi-Adi-Mundi leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Core Starships. They cut a swath through masses of Droids until they arrive at the Command Core Starship. Some Jedi fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAYKi-Adi-Mundi and the surviving Jedi fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing Droids.EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAYThe body of Threepio with the battle droid head is fired upon and knocked back to the ground. The battle droid head goes flying off Threepio’s body. COLEMAN TREBOR, one of the Jedi Council, leaps into the Archducal box and swings at Count Dooku, but is repeatedly shot and sent falling to the arena floor by Jango’s blaster. Jango coolly twirls his blaster and replaces it on his holster. The Reek charges, separating Obi-Wan and Mace Windu. The beast chases Mace across the arena. Mace swipes at the Reek, chopping off one of its’ horns. The Reek still catches Mace with its shoulder, sending Mace sprawling and losing his lightsaber. Jango Fett, watching from above, rockets down and lands behind him in the arena. Mace grabs his lightsaber, and the Reek tosses Jango away. Jango ends up under the Reek, avoiding the creature’s massive hoofs. Finally Fett is free and kills the Reek. Jango stands and whips around looking for Mace with both blasters raised. Mace leaps down from the stands and charges forward. Jango desperately opens fire but Mace deflects all the bolts as he runs. Mace lunges with his lightsaber at Jango's head and Jango ducks, but is left off balance. Jango manages one blast from his arm-mounted blaster, but it misses. Mace spins and slices across and downward. Jango's helmet, with his head still inside, bounces and rolls in the dust. His body falls to the dirt.INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE – DAYKi-Adi-Mundi and his group of Jedi burst onto the bridge and chop down the command droids. The Neimoidians flee in all directions. Ki-Adi-Mundi leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the droids on the Starship FREEZE! EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAYAll the droids in the arena freeze as well. There is a moment of stunned silence, then the Jedi cheer. INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE – DAYOn the bridge, Plo Koon claps Ki-Adi-Mundi on the back.PLO KOON: We've done it! Now we have a chance!Suddenly, there is a harsh beeping sound. All the droids on the Starship start fighting again! Ki-Adi-Mundi stares in disbelief and dismay.EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAYThe droids in the arena have started fighting again as well, and the Jedi are even harder pressed. The Threepio/Battle Droid continues to fire on the Jedi, hitting and killing several. THREEPIO’S HEAD: (battle droid voice) DIE, JEDI DOGS!! (normal voice) Oh – what did I say?!?Up in the Archducal Box, Nute and Rune cringe and jump from several near-miss blaster bolts. Among the tiers, the Jedi are slowly being driven back and whittled down. They have killed heaps of Geonosians and knocked out piles of droids, but the sheer numbers are telling. Individual Jedi are being cut down or blasted. The rest continue to retreat into the arena. THREEPIO’S HEAD: Oh dear, I’m terribly sorry about all this…The Jedi Master KIT FISTO uses the Force to knock the Threepio/Battle Droid backward onto the arena floor. A downed Super battle droid falls on top of Threepio’s battle droid body, pinning him to the ground. Fisto grins and rejoins the battle. THREEPIO’S HEAD: Excuse me? I’m trapped, I can’t get up…A droideka nails and kills the Orray, knocking the execution cart to the ground. Anakin wields his lightsaber and Padme uses a blaster rifle to defend themselves, using the fallen execution wagon for protection. ANAKIN: You call this a “diplomatic solution”? PADME: (grins) No, I call it “aggressive negotiations”!  Obi-Wan dodges the fire of two battle droids…who suddenly move back in the cybernetic equivalent of panic. BATTLE DROID #1: Uh oh!!BATTLE DROID #2: Roger roger!!Obi-Wan turns and faces the irate Acklay. But this time he’s ready – swinging his lightsaber, he chops off two of the creature’s claws and slices into its’ side. The Acklay sags to the ground, moaning. Obi-Wan brings his blade over his head and skewers the Acklay’s skull. Artoo finds the battle droid body with Threepio’s head attached. THREEPIO: Artoo, what are you doing here?He shoots a projectile from his body that attaches a suction device to Threepio’s head, and pulls the head away from the battle droid. THREEPIO: What are you doing?!? Stop that! You’re going to strain something – my head!! Now where are you taking me?? Oh, this is such a drag…I’m quite beside myself. Artoo drags Threepio’s head across the arena and reattaches it to Threepio’s body, using an extendable welding arm. THREEPIO: Artoo, please be careful! You’re singeing my circuits. Is my head on straight? Soon, the fifteen exhausted remaining Jedi (plus Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme) are completely hemmed in to the center of the arena by countless battle droids. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of dead Geonosians, shattered droids, and Jedi. Silence. Dooku lifts his hand, and the droids lower their weapons.Ki-Adi-Mundi and the survivors from the raiding party are herded into the group by Super Battle Droids. From the encircling tiers above, thousands of battle droids level their weapons menacingly. The Jedi group forms a small defensive circle, ready to fight to the last man. COUNT DOOKU: Master Windu, you have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the archives of the Jedi Order. Now… it is finished.  (pauses briefly) Surrender - and your lives will be spared.MACE WINDU: We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku! Again, a shadow of genuine grief and regret crosses Dooku’s face. Momentarily. COUNT DOOKU: Then… I’m sorry, old friend. You will all have to be destroyed. The droids raise their weapons. Anakin and Padme look hopelessly at each other, and the Jedi raise their lightsabers and brace themselves for the last stand. Dooku lifts his hand to give the attack order --PADME: LOOK!!!Amidala points up to the sky -- six giant assault/attack gunships descend into and around the arena. They set down in a cluster around the handful of Jedi. Upon landing, thousands of clonetroopers emerge from these six ships and start firing up at the droids. There is a hellstorm of laser fire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. Yoda appears at the door of one of the Gunships. YODA: Around the survivors a perimeter create!! MACE WINDU: JEDI, MOVE!!!!The surviving Jedi dash to the Gunships and scramble in. Mace Windu hangs on tight and blocks blaster fire with his lightsaber (as does Ki-Adi Mundi) as the Gunship, firing all its’ weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim. Grimacing, Dooku turns and walks into the inner corridors of the arena. On the arena grounds, Artoo beeps as Threepio tries to sit up. THREEPIO: Oh…what happened? I had the most peculiar dream…In another part of the deserted arena, Boba Fett finds his father’s battered helmet. Sinking to his knees, he picks it up and touches it gently to his forehead. He lowers his head in sorrow. EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA – DAYOutside on the flat terrain below, a line of parked Trade Federation and Commerce Guild Battle Ships and legions of Battle Droids surround the arena. However, dozens of giant wedge-shaped Republic warships begin to land on the countryside surrounding them. The Republic Gunships carrying the Jedi circle towering stalagmites as they head toward the assembly point. Winged Geonosians fire laser cannons up at the Gunships. INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE -- DAYMace Windu stares down at the incredible sight. YODA: If escapes Dooku does, rally more systems to his cause he will. Capture him we must.INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO – DAYGround fire and explosions rock the Gunship. Padme, Anakin and Obi-Wan steady themselves. OBI-WAN: Hold on! EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAYGunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.  INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO – DAYObi-Wan, Anakin and Padme watch from the open Gunship. On the battleground below, Clone Troopers riding speeder bikes advance toward the battlefield. Trade Federation Spider Droids fire at the Clone Troopers and Republic Gunships. Lightsaber-wielding Jedi slash through Battle Droids. The battle rages on. Gunship #1 flies low toward Techno Union starships. ANAKIN: Aim right above the fuel cells. Laser fire pelts the base of the Techno Union ship. Rocked with explosions, it begins to tilt over and the Gunships split up, flying past. OBI-WAN: Good call, my young Padawan! EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAYThe landed Republic warships begin to spew out thousands of LAAT/i’s (Troop Gunships), LAAT/C’s (Cargo Gunships), and AT-TE’s (Walker Tanks) as well as hundreds of thousands of Clone Troopers. The Clonetroopers open fire with artillery. Explosions caused by the Gunships wreck the parked Battleships. The Gunships open the rear of their ships and release hundreds of Military Swoops and the Cargo Gunships carry the Walker Tanks laden with troopers into the midst of the battleground.INT. GEONOSIS, COMMAND CENTER – DAYPoggle, Dooku, Nute and RUNE HAAKO rush into a huge command center. In the center of the room there is a large circular holo-viewscreen and around the perimeter of the room Geonosian soldiers monitor the Clone Army’s advances on large semitransparent maps. In one corner of the room there is a large monitor flashing a variety of images, like schematics to a planet-sized mechanized superweapon.NUTE GUNRAY: The Jedi have amassed a huge army! COUNT DOOKU: Where did they get them? That doesn’t seem possible. How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly? NUTE GUNRAY: We must send all available droids into battle! Dooku shakes his head. COUNT DOOKU: There are too many. They will soon have us surrounded. In the near distance, a massive explosion. POGGLE: (subtitled) Our communications have been jammed. We are under attack on land and from above.EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAYThe Gunships struggle towards the Republic assembly area, trading fire with the landed Federation and Techno Union starships.INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE -- DAYThe Jedi wince as the Gunship alongside them is blown to bits by enemy fire. MACE WINDU: PILOT!! Land at that assembly area!! CLONE CAPTAIN: Yes, sir.EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAYGunship #1 lands. Mace Windu, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Kit Fisto and Clone Troopers spill from the Gunship. A Clone Captain runs up to Mace. CLONE CAPTAIN: Sir, I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir. Mace nods and points in the direction of the growing battlefield. Still on the Gunship, Yoda shouts at the pilot. YODA: To the forward command center take me!!Gunship #1 lifts off with Yoda on board. Mace and the Jedi join the swarms of Clone Troopers in the ground battle. The two forces close in on each other, filling the skies with laser fire and smoke. INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE – DAYFrom his vantage point at the open door, Yoda watches the battle unfold below him. The Clone Troopers open fire with artillery. Explosions wreck the parked Battle Starships. Clone Troopers advance, firing at the massed droids. Droid starfighters fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and Jedi Starfighters. YODA: More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide.INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO – DAYStill on his Gunship with Anakin and Padme, Obi-Wan points outward. OBI-WAN: Target those Federation starships quickly!! One Trade Federation starship begins to rise from its’ docking port. Gunship #2 and another Gunship fires on the starship, with no apparent damage. ANAKIN: They’re too big, Master. The ground troops will have to take them out. INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE – DAYGunship #1 lands at the makeshift Command Center. Yoda disembarks and walks to the Clone Commander. CLONE COMMANDER: Master Yoda, all forward positions are advancing. YODA: Very good. Very good.EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAYSeveral Cargo Gunships land just long enough to drop AT-TE’s from their bellies and then lift off again. Several rolling Confederacy anti-air droids try to shoot the Gunships out of the sky. INT. GEONOSIS, COMMAND CENTER – DAYDooku, Poggle, Nute and Rune stand around the viewscreen. The screen shows the Confederacy’s droid army slowly being overcome by the Republic clone army. NUTE GUNRAY: This is not looking good at all…RUNE HAAKO: We must order the starships back into space. Nute and Rune turn and run out of the room. POGGLE: (subtitled) We have to order a retreat. COUNT DOOKU: I’m going to Coruscant. My master will never let the Republic get away with this treachery. POGGLE: (subtitled) I’m sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs.As Dooku waits, Poggle crosses to the holographic schematic. With a few keystrokes, he downloads the image into a small holoprojector and hands it to Dooku. POGGLE: The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon. If they find out what we are planning to build, we’re doomed. Dooku activates the holoprojector and regards the moon-sized battle station thoughtfully. COUNT DOOKU: I will take the designs with me to Coruscant. They will be much safer there with my master. With a bow, the Count sweeps out of the room. EXT. GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAYThe Gunships rain hellfire down on the battle droids and anti-air rolling droids as they rush toward the launching Federation core ships. The Confederacy forces are slowly being whittled down.INT. CATACOMB HANGAR – DAYNute Gunray and Rune Haako rush up into their Neimoidian shuttle. The shuttle rises and shoots out of the catacomb hangar into the sky. Nearby, Count Dooku mounts a speeder bike and sets out onto the rocky landscape with two Geonosian starfighters as escort. INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO – DAYThe Gunships continues to fire on the Trade Federation Core ships. The core ships continue to lift into the sky.EXT. COMMAND CENTER – DAYYODA: Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship! CLONE COMMANDER: Yes, sir. (to his troops) All quadrants to Sector 515!!Several ground artillery ships open fire on the rising core ship, spearing it with blue laser fire. The Trade Federation core ship finally begins to weaken under the constant fire. The starship begins to fall and then crashes into the ground, causing a tsunami of dust to cover the battlefield. INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO – DAYObi-Wan, Anakin and Padme are at the open sides of Gunship #2 as it flies through the massive dust cloud. Clones fire down at the droids below. The dust is filled with red and blue laser bolts.The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.OBI-WAN: Look over there!!Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder Bike racing past. On the bike is the unmistakable figure of Count Dooku.ANAKIN: It's Dooku!! Shoot him down!!CLONE CAPTAIN: We’re out of rockets, sir. ANAKIN: Follow him!PADME: We’re going to need some help! OBI-WAN: There isn’t time!! Anakin and I can handle this!!!! Dooku signals the two starfighters flanking his ship. They veer off left and right, loop around, and come up under our heroes’ Gunship. To avoid the Beakwing fire, the Gunship banks up a steep dune but is still hit. The gunship lurches on its side, and a screaming Padme and a Clone Officer are violently flung out of the open doors – ANAKIN: PADME!!!!He stares down in horror as Padme hits the ground below and tumbles down the dune. ANAKIN: PUT THE SHIP DOWN!! DOWN!!!!!OBI-WAN: Anakin, don’t let your personal feelings get in the way! (to the pilot) Follow that speeder!!The Gunship continues its’ pursuit of Dooku’s speeder, followed by the two Beakwing fighters. ANAKIN: LOWER THE SHIP!!OBI-WAN: I CAN’T TAKE DOOKU ALONE!!! I NEED YOU!!! IF WE CATCH HIM, WE CAN END THIS WAR RIGHT NOW!! WE HAVE A JOB TO DO!!!ANAKIN: I DON’T CARE!! PUT THE SHIP DOWN!!!OBI-WAN: YOU WILL BE EXPELLED FROM THE JEDI ORDER!!!ANAKIN: I CAN’T LEAVE HER!!OBI-WAN: COME TO YOUR SENSES!! What do you think Padme would do if she were in your position? That question stops Anakin up short. He sighs and lowers his head. ANAKIN: She would do her duty.  EXT. COMMAND CENTER – DAYYoda stands next to the Clone Commander. He senses something is wrong with Padme. YODA: Hmmm…CLONE COMMANDER: The droid army is in full retreat. YODA: Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship. EXT. GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAYCount Dooku’s speeder bike shoots into the open door of a tower; the Gunship pauses next to it to long enough for Obi-Wan and Anakin leap down and run inside the tower. As the Gunship rises back into the air, it is destroyed by the two Beakwings. INT. GEONOSIS SECRET HANGAR TOWER – LATE DAYCount Dooku throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is parked nearby. The two Jedi rush into the hangar, lightsabers ignited and ready. Dooku smiles at the two with amusement. ANAKIN: You’re going to pay for all of the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.OBI-WAN: We’ll take him together. You slowly on the --ANAKIN: No, I’m taking him NOW!!!Without listening or thinking, an enraged Anakin charges at Dooku. OBI-WAN: NO ANAKIN, NO!!!But just as the young apprentice is about to strike his first blow, Dooku calmly lifts his arm and shoots purple lightning out at the young man. Anakin is lifted up and flung across the room, slamming hard into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, barely conscious. Obi-Wan regards Dooku in horror. COUNT DOOKU: Kenobi, is it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now back down. Dooku fires another volley of lightning from his fingertips; Obi-Wan intercepts it with his lightsaber. The electricity ripples around the blue blade and fades into nothingness. OBI-WAN: I don’t think so. Obi-Wan raises his lightsaber, ready for battle.COUNT DOOKU: Ah, but if I must…Dooku pulls out a curved lightsaber handle, and a scarlet blade shoots out of it. He raises it to his face in salute and moves into a fencer’s en garde stance. COUNT DOOKU: I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely more power.OBI-WAN: Prove it. Obi-Wan charges at Dooku, lightsaber twirling. The two clash blades in a furious exchange of swings. Dooku handles his lightsaber much like a master fencer with his foil. Using calculated moves and expending little energy, Dooku easily blocks Obi-Wan’s wide, sweeping strikes. COUNT DOOKU: Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. He parries another blow from Obi-Wan.COUNT DOOKU: Surely you can do better? Another parry. COUNT DOOKU: No, you can’t. I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? Which is it?Dooku thrusts. Obi-Wan jumps back, gasping for breath. COUNT DOOKU: (mocking) Come come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. Obi-Wan takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber, and comes in again. For a moment, he drives Count Dooku back. Then Dooku’s superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces Obi-Wan to retreat. At the wall, Anakin groans and writhes in pain. EXT. GEONOSIS DUNES – LATE DAYOn the ground, Padme groans as well. A Clone Trooper rushes up and approaches her. CLONE TROOPER: Are you all right? Padme slowly regains her feet.PADME: Yes…I think so. CLONE TROOPER: We’d better get back to the forward Command Center. PADME: No, no. Gather what troops you can. We’ve got to get to that hangar! Get a transport! HURRY!!CLONE TROOPER: Right away!!The two run toward the distant battlefield.INT. GEONOSIS SECRET HANGAR TOWER – LATE DAYDooku increases the tempo of his attack. Obi-Wan is pushed to the limit to defend himself. Dooku presses. Obi-Wan makes a lunging slash, and a laughing Dooku catches it. The two struggle in a test of strength, the two energy blades straining against each other. Dooku wins the test and runs his blade through Obi-Wan’s shoulder. The younger Jedi screams in agony and drops his blade. Dooku then slices Obi-Wan’s leg for good measure. Obi-Wan stumbles back against the wall, trips, and crashes to the ground. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor. COUNT DOOKU: And so it ends…With a shrug, he raises his blade for the final blow as Obi-Wan stares at him helplessly – -- and Anakin’s blade blocks it in mid-swing!!Dooku is shocked and takes a step back. He regards Anakin with incredulity. COUNT DOOKU: Brave of you, boy – but I thought you’d learned your lesson.ANAKIN: (sneers) I am a slow learner. Anakin begins a flurry of attacks on Dooku. The fury of his attack catches Dooku off-guard, and he staggers back. Anakin swings and nicks him, and Dooku gasps and clutches the side of his arm. He pulls his hand away and stares at his blood, then looks at Anakin with a new respect. COUNT DOOKU: You have unusual powers, my young Padawan. But not enough to save you this time. ANAKIN: Don’t bet on it! OBI-WAN: ANAKIN!! Obi-Wan uses the Force to fling his lightsaber at Anakin. He catches it. Anakin skillfully wields the two lightsabers with relative ease. Dooku parries and ripostes. It’s no contest. Dooku knocks Obi-Wan’s green lightsaber from Anakin's hand and relentless drives Anakin back. Anakin retreats, slicing a power cable on the floor. The hangar is cast into darkness, except for the blue and scarlet lights of the lightsaber blades. Another fierce, lightning-fast clash of blades. With a roar, Anakin thrusts forward -- and Dooku cuts Anakin’s sword arm off at the elbow. Before he even has the chance to scream, Dooku throws out his hand and Anakin is Force-shoved across the room. He falls and skids to a halt beside Obi-Wan’s body, driven unconscious by the shock and pain. Dooku sighs and extinguishes his lightsaber, suddenly seeming much older. He looks up and turns at a tapping noise at the hangar door…Slowly, through the thick smoke, the tiny figure of Yoda hobbles into view. He stops on the smoke-filled threshold.YODA: Count Dooku. COUNT DOOKU: Master Yoda. Dooku steps away from Obi-Wan and Anakin. For the first time, a hint of fear enters Dooku’s eyes. COUNT DOOKU: You have interfered in our affairs for the last time. Now we shall see who is the most powerful.  Dooku levitates machinery in the room and hurtles it at the tiny figure of the Jedi Master. Yoda effortlessly deflects the machinery and strikes a martial arts pose.Dooku then causes great boulders in the ceiling above Yoda to fall. Again, Yoda deflects the boulders, which fall around him. YODA: Powerful you have become, Dooku. The Dark Side I sense in you. COUNT DOOKU: I’ve become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you.  Dooku thrusts out his arm, flinging out purple Force lightning. Yoda catches the lightning in his hand – balls it up – and hurtles it right back at him!! Dooku deflects it into the wall, but just barely. He shoots more lightning out. Yoda again catches it in his hand, and it absorbs into his palm. YODA: Much to learn you still have. COUNT DOOKU: It is obvious this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force…Dooku reignites his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU: …but by our skills with a lightsaber. YODA: No interest in contests do I have. Dooku whirls his lightsaber in a formal salute. Yoda Force-pulls his lightsaber out from under his robe and ignites it.  Yoda attacks! He flies forward with a screeching yell. Dooku is forced to retreat. Words are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda’s speed and swordplay. The little gnome’s lightsaber is a blur of emerald-green light, too fast for Dooku to defend against. He smoothly blocks Dooku’s blows and spins through the air like a tiny tornado, bouncing off the Sail Ship and the hangar wall. Finally, their blades cross and the fighting slows. Yoda inches closer and quietly speaks…YODA: Fought well you have, my old Padawan. But the end for you this is. COUNT DOOKU: The battle is far from over. This is just the beginning -- Mustering all the strength he can find, Dooku suddenly dislodges Yoda and, using the Force, brings one of the huge hanging ceiling cranes in the hangar crashing down on Obi-Wan and Anakin. In the blink of an eye, Yoda closes his eyes and concentrates. The fallen crane trembles and starts to lift. Count Dooku runs up the ship’s ramp, throwing a last look back before going inside. Obi-Wan is still awake and tries to add what little strength he has left into helping his old master. Yoda concentrates harder. Slowly, with their combined power, the crane rises. Yoda exerts every ounce of his powers. The crane lifts clear of Obi-Wan and Anakin and is thrown to the ground.The Sail Ship’s ramp closes, and the sound of the ship's engines are heard starting up.EXT. GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – LATE DAYAnother Gunship floats beside the open door of the hangar. Padme and several Clone Troopers race out of it. In the hangar, the sound of the engines increases. Dooku’s Sailor Ship takes off through a hangar portal. Padme and the Clone Troopers shoot at it, but it is too late. The Sailor Ship rises into the air and flies away into the sunset sky.EXT. GEONOSIS -- SPACE Passing one of the rising Trade Federation battleships, the solar sails unfurl on Dooku’s ship. It blurs away into hyperspace. INT. GEONOSIS SECRET HANGAR TOWER – LATE DAYAnakin slowly awakens, bathed in sweat and moaning in agony. Yoda sighs heavily at the sad sight and summons his gimer stick back into his hand, sagging onto it with all the weight of his advanced years. Obi-Wan slowly pulls himself up, hobbling on his injured leg. PADME: (O.S.) ANAKIN!!Padme and the Clone Troopers rush in. The very sight of Padme reinvigorates Anakin, and he pulls himself up as well. Padme runs up to Anakin and throws her arms around him. Anakin is so tired and exhausted that he can barely stand. The clone captain approaches Yoda.                                                            CLONE CAPTAIN: Resistance is at an end, General. Awaiting your orders. Yoda sighs again. YODA: A dark day it is…WIPE TO:  EXT. SPACE – CORUSCANTCount Dooku’s Interstellar Sail Ship emerges from hyperspace and floats toward the glittering world of Coruscant. The golden solar sails fold up and move back into the tiny vessel. EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN – DAWNThe Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. Count Dooku maneuvers his ship into one of the empty buildings and lands. INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM – DAWNThe ramp lowers. Count Dooku walks down the ramp and into the abandoned hangar, where he is then greeted by the hooded figure of Darth Sidious. Dooku bows. COUNT DOOKU: The Force is with us, Master Sidious.                                                            DARTH SIDIOUS: Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.  COUNT DOOKU: I bring good news for you, my Lord. War has begun. DARTH SIDIOUS: Excellent. Everything is going as planned. Only a triumphant smile is seen from beneath the black hood. EXT. CORUSCANT – JEDI TEMPLE – SUNSETThe beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun. INT. JEDI TEMPLE, JEDI COUNCIL CHAMBER -- SUNSETObi-Wan and Mace Windu stand and look out through the tall windows of the Council Chamber at the great plaza below. Yoda sits in his chair. OBI-WAN: Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the Senate? It doesn’t feel right…YODA: Joined the Dark Side Dooku has. Lies…deceit…creating mistrust are his ways now. MACE WINDU: Nevertheless, I feel we should keep a closer eye on the Senate. YODA: I agree. MACE WINDU: Where is your apprentice? OBI-WAN: On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala. (beat, then an attempt at cheer) I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory. From his seat, a sad Yoda scowls at Obi-Wan. He is the only other person in the room – all the other Council chairs are chillingly empty. YODA: Victory?!? ‘Victory’, you say? Master Obi-Wan… (shakes his head) not a victory. A defeat it was. The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has…EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING ARENA, BALCONY -- SUNSETChancellor Palpatine, Bail Organa, Mas Amedda, Jar Jar Binks, and the other members of the Loyalist Committee stand on a balcony and, with deeply sad expressions on their faces, oversee a dreadful site to behold in the square below… Beneath them prevails a military staging arena where tens of thousands of Clone Troopers are drawn up in strict formation or move forward in neat files to climb the ramps of Military Assault Ships. In the background, loaded Assault Ships rise into the air, and others land immediately to take their place. The sky beyond is thick with rising and falling transports. Clone troops march and board the ships. Bail pounds his fist against the balcony railing in frustration; Palpatine’s face is carefully neutral. The Clone Wars have begun. EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN – LATE DAYIn a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling lake, Anakin and Padme stand before a Naboo holy man. Anakin now has a robotic, skeletal looking arm grafted to his elbow.The two trusty droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, are the only members in attendance during this eminent occasion. Artoo has been polished up; Threepio is still in his beat-up tin plating.  Anakin takes Padme’s hand with his remaining one; Padme slowly does the same with his robot hand. The holy man turns and leaves. As rose petals fall all around them, they move in close and kiss.  Threepio rests his hand on Artoo’s dome. Anakin and Padme slowly break the kiss and look outward, towards the horizon, towards the setting sun…IRIS OUT.END CREDITS PLAY OVER A STARFIELD. FADE OUT.Directed by.......................................…………......GEORGE LUCASScreenplay By……………………………………….GEORGE LUCAS, JONATHAN HALESStory By………………………………………………GEORGE LUCASProduced by..........................................................RICK McCALLUMExecutive Producer..............................................GEORGE LUCASDirector of Photography.............................……..DAVID TATTERSALL, B.S.C.Production Designer..............................................GAVIN BOCQUETEditor and Sound Designer…………………………BEN BURTTCostume Designer.................................................TRISHA BIGGARCasting by.....................................................……..ROBIN GURLANDMusic by......................................................……….JOHN WILLIAMSStarringEWAN MCGREGORNATALIE PORTMANHAYDEN CHRISTENSENAND FRANK OZ AS YODACo-StarringIAN MCDIARMIDPERNILLA AUGUSTAHMED BESTOLIVER FORD DAVIESTEMUERA MORRISONANTHONY DANIELSSILAS CARSONKENNY BAKERWith SAMUEL L.
