Network analysis of Star Wars The Attack of the Clones in R
==================================================

This is a free adaptation of two (very) clever analyses made by others:

* [The Star Wars Social Network by Evelina Gabasov](http://evelinag.com/blog/2015/12-15-star-wars-social-network) in which program F# was mostly used to analyse the Star wars social networks 

* [Analyzing networks of characters in 'Love Actually' by David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/r/love-actually-network/) in which R was used to analyse the links between the characters of the movie Love Actually.

The aim here is to try and reproduce Evelina's analysis using R only, using David's contribution plus several tweaks I 
found here and there on the internet. The results can be seen on [this post](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/post/star_wars_in_r/).

_Disclaimer_: The original blog posts are awesome and full of relevant details, check them out! 
My objective here was to teach myself how to manipulate data using trendy R packages and do some network analyses. 
Some comments in the R script have been copied and pasted from these blogs, the credits entirely go to the authors Evelina and David. 
Last but not least, my code comes with mistakes probably.
